<h2>Bicriterion iterated local search heuristic</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the bicriterion algorithm BILS for
anticlustering by Brusco et al. (2020;
&lt;doi:10.1111/bmsp.12186&gt;). The description of their algorithm is
given in Section 3 of their paper (in particular, see the
Pseudocode in their Figure 2). As of anticlust version 0.8.6, this
function also includes some extensions to the BILS algorithm that
are implemented through the optional arguments
<code>dispersion_distances</code>, <code>average_diversity</code>,
<code>init_partitions</code>, and <code>return</code>. If these arguments are
not changed, the function performs the "vanilla" BILS as described
in Brusco et al.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data input. Can be one of two structures: (1) A
feature matrix where rows correspond to elements and columns
correspond to variables (a single numeric variable can be
passed as a vector). (2) An N x N matrix dissimilarity matrix;
can be an object of class <code>dist</code> (e.g., returned by
<code>dist</code> or <code>as.dist</code>) or a <code>matrix</code>
where the entries of the upper and lower triangular matrix
represent pairwise dissimilarities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>How many anticlusters should be created. Alternatively:
(a) A vector describing the size of each group, or (b) a vector
of length <code>nrow(x)</code> describing how elements are assigned
to anticlusters before the optimization starts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R</code></td>
<td>
<p>The desired number of restarts for the algorithm. By
default, both phases (MBPI + ILS) of the algorithm are
performed once.  See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>W</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional argument, a vector of weights defining the
relative importance of dispersion and diversity (0 &lt;= W &lt;=
1). See details.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Xi</code></td>

<p>Optional argument, specifies probability of swapping
elements during the iterated local search. See examples.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dispersion_distances</code></td>

<p>A distance matrix used to compute the
dispersion if the dispersion should not be computed on the
basis of argument <code>x</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>average_diversity</code></td>

global sum across all pairwise within-group distances, but as
the sum of the average of within-group distances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init_partitions</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of initial partitions (rows =
partitions; columns = elements) that serve as starting
partitions during the iterations of the first phase of the BILS
(i.e., the MBPI).  If not passed, a new random partition is
generated at the start of each iteration (which is the default
behaviour).</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The bicriterion algorithm by Brusco et al. (2020) aims to
simultaneously optimize two anticlustering criteria: the
<code>diversity_objective</code> and the
<code>dispersion_objective</code>. It returns a list of partitions
that approximate the pareto set of efficient solutions across both
criteria. By considering both the diversity and dispersion, this
algorithm is well-suited for maximizing overall within-group
heterogeneity. To select a partition among the approximated pareto
set, it is reasonable to plot the objectives for each partition
(see Examples).
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>R</code>, <code>W</code> and <code>Xi</code> are named for
consistency with Brusco et al. (2020). The argument <code>K</code> is
used for consistency with other functions in anticlust; Brusco et
al. used 'G' to denote the number of groups. However, note that
<code>K</code> can not only be used to denote the number of equal-sized
groups, but also to specify group sizes, as in
<code>anticlustering</code>.
</p>
<p>This function implements the combined bicriterion algorithm BILS,
which consists of two phases: The multistart bicriterion pairwise
interchange heuristic (MBPI, which is a local maximum search
heuristic similar to <code>method = "local-maximum"</code> in
<code>anticlustering</code>), and the iterated local search (ILS),
which is an improvement procedure that tries to overcome local
optima.  The argument <code>R</code> denotes the number of restarts of
the two phases of the algorithm. If <code>R</code> has length 1, half of
the repetitions perform the first phase MBPI), the other half
perform the ILS.  If <code>R</code> has length 2, the first entry
indicates the number of restarts of MBPI the second entry indicates
the number of restarts of ILS.  The argument <code>W</code> denotes the
relative weight given to the diversity and dispersion criterion in
a given run of the search heuristic. In each run, the a weight is
randomly selected from the vector <code>W</code>. As default values, we
use the weights that Brusco et al. used in their analyses. All
values in <code>W</code> have to be in [0, 1]; larger values indicate
that diversity is more important, whereas smaller values indicate
that dispersion is more important; <code>w = .5</code> implies the same
weight for both criteria. The argument <code>Xi</code> is the probability
that an element is swapped during the iterated local search
(specifically, Xi has to be a vector of length 2, denoting the
range of a uniform distribution from which the probability of
swapping is selected). For <code>Xi</code>, the default is selected
consistent with the analyses by Brusco et al.
</p>
<p>If the data input <code>x</code> is a feature matrix (that is: each row
is a "case" and each column is a "variable"), a matrix of the
Euclidean distances is computed as input to the algorithm. If a
different measure of dissimilarity is preferred, you may pass a
self-generated dissimilarity matrix via the argument <code>x</code>.  The
argument <code>dispersion_distances</code> can additionally be used if
the dispersion should be computed on the basis of a different
distance matrix.
</p>
<p>If multiple <code>init_partitions</code> are given, ensure that each
partition (i.e., each row of<code>init_partitions</code>) has the exact
same output of <code>table</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>By default, a <code>matrix</code> of anticlustering partitions
(i.e., the approximated pareto set). Each row corresponds to a
partition, each column corresponds to an input element. If the
argument <code>return</code> is set to either "best-diversity", 
"best-average-diversity", or "best-dispersion", it only returns one 
partition (as a vector), that maximizes the respective objective.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For technical reasons, the pareto set returned by this function has
a limit of 500 partitions. Usually however, the
algorithm usually finds much fewer partitions. There is one following exception:
We do not recommend to use this method when the input data is
one-dimensional where the algorithm may identify too many
equivalent partitions causing it to run very slowly (see section 5.6 in 
Breuer, 2020).
