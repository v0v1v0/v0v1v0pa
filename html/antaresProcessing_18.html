<h2>Synthesize Monte-Carlo scenarios</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes as input an object of class <code>antaresData</code> containing
detailed results of a simulation and creates a synthesis of the results.
The synthesis contains the average value of each variable over Monte-Carlo
scenarios and eventually other aggregated statistics
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">synthesize(x, ..., prefixForMeans = "", useTime = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>antaresData</code> created with
<code>readAntares</code> and containing detailed results of
an Antares simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional parameters indicating which additional statistics to produce.
See details to see how to specify them.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prefixForMeans</code></td>
<td>
<p>Prefix to add to the columns containing average values. If it is different
than "", a "_" is automatically added.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>use times columns for synthesize.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Additional statistics can be asked in three different ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> A character string in "min", "max", "std", "median" or "qXXX" where
"XXX" is a real number between 0 and 100. It will add
for each column respectively the minimum or maximum value, the standard
deviation, the median or a quantile.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A named argument whose value is a function or one of the previous
aliases. For instance <code>med = median</code> will calculate the median of
each variable. The name of the resulting column will be prefixed by
"med_". Similarly, <code>l = "q5"</code> will compute the 5
each variable and put the result in a column with name prefixed by "l_"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A named argument whose value is a list. It has to contain an element
<code>fun</code> equal to a function or an alias and optionally an element
<code>only</code> containing the names of the columns to which to apply the function.
For instance <code>med = list(fun = median, only = c("LOAD", "MRG. PRICE"))</code>
will compute the median of variables "LOAD" and "MRG. PRICE". The result
will be stored in columns "med_LOAD" and "med_MRG. PRICE".
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The computation of custom statistics can take some time, especially with hourly
data. To improve performance, prefer the third form and compute custom
statistics only on a few variables.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Synthetic version of the input data. It has the same structure as <code>x</code>
except that column <code>mcYear</code> has been removed. All variables are
averaged across Monte-Carlo scenarios and eventually some additional columns
have been added corresponding to the requested custom statistics.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
mydata &lt;- readAntares("all", timeStep = "annual")

synthesize(mydata)

# Add minimum and maximum for all variables
synthesize(mydata, "min", "max")

# Compute a custom statistic for all columns
synthesize(mydata, log = function(x) mean(log(1 + x)))

# Same but only for column "LOAD"
synthesize(mydata,
           log = list(fun = function(x) mean(log(1 + x)),
                      only = "LOAD"))

# Compute the proportion of time balance is positive

synthesize(mydata, propPos = list(fun = function(x) mean(x &gt; 0),
                                  only = "BALANCE"))

# Compute 95% confidence interval for the marginal price
synthesize(mydata,
           l = list(fun = "q2.5", only = "MRG. PRICE"),
           u = list(fun = "q97.5", only = "MRG. PRICE"))

## End(Not run)
