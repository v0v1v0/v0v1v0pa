<h2>Create a Menzerath-Altmann Plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a Menzerath-Altmann plot from a data frame in long format. The plot visualizes the relationship between the number of elements in sequences and the mean duration of these sequences.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">menzerath_plot(sequences_long)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequences_long</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame in long format. It should include columns for 'sequence_nr', 'start_time', and 'end_time'. Each row represents an element in the sequence with its start and end times.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function calculates the duration of each element as the difference between 'end_time' and 'start_time'. It then groups the data by 'sequence_nr' to compute the number of elements and the mean duration of each sequence. The resulting plot helps in understanding the relationship described by the Menzerath-Altmann law, which postulates that larger linguistic units tend to have shorter mean durations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A 'ggplot' object. The plot shows the number of elements (x-axis) against the mean duration of sequences (y-axis) with a linear regression line.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Sample data frame
sequences_long &lt;- data.frame(
  sequence_nr = rep(1:5, each = 3),
  start_time = rep(1:3, times = 5),
  end_time = rep(2:4, times = 5)
)
menzerath_plot(sequences_long)
</code></pre>
