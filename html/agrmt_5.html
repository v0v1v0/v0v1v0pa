<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements the AJUS-system introduced by Galtung (1969). The input is a frequency vector; the output is a classification of the distribution.
</p>
<p>Distributions are classified as A if they are unimodal with a peak in the centre, as J if they are unimodal with a peak at either end, as U if they are bimodal with a peak at both ends, and as S if they are multimodal. In addition to Galtung's classification, the function classifies distributions as F if there is no peak and all values are more or less the same (flat). Furthermore, a distinction is drawn between J and L distributions, depending on whether they increase or decrease: J types have a peak on the right, L types have the peak on the left. The skew is given as +1 for a positive skew, as 0 for no skew, and -1 for a negative skew.
</p>
<p>The skew is identified by comparing the sum of values left and right of the midpoint respectively. For J-type of distributions, the skew is identified on the basis of the changes between values. This way, long tails cannot influence the skew, and a single peak at the left and right-hand end can be differentiated in all cases.
</p>
<p>The aim of the AJUS system is to reduce complexity. Initially the intuition was to classify distributions on an ad-hoc basis (i.e. eye-balling). Using an algorithm is certainly more reliable, and useful if one is interested in classifying (and comparing) a large number of distributions. The argument <code>tolerance</code>, however is not a trivial choice and can affect results. Use the helper function <code>ajusCheck</code> to check sensitivity to different values of the tolerance parameter.
</p>
<p>You can choose between a strict AJUS classification and a modified AJUSFL classification (default). The AJUS classification does not include a type for distributions without peaks (F type), and NA is returned instead. The AJUS classification does not draw a distinction between unimodal distributions with a peak at the end: the skew needs to be considered to distinguish between increasing and decreasing cases. The modified variant (default) includes the F type and the L type along with the original AJUS types.</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a list. The <code>type</code> returns a string corresponding to the pattern described by Galtung (A,J,U,S) or (F,L). The <code>skew</code> returns a number to describe the direction of the skew. The <code>pattern</code> returns the simplified pattern of the distribution. It indicates whether two values were considered the same (0), or if there was an increase (1) or decrease (-1) between two consecutive values. The length of the pattern is equal to the length of the frequency vector minus one.</p>
