<h2>Stroop data from Lin et al. (2020, Psych. Science)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lin, Saunders, Friese, Evans, and Inzlicht (2020) investigated ego depletion.
An initial high-demand task was followed by a Stroop task. The data of the
Stroop task from all 4 of their studies is included here.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Their abstract: People feel tired or depleted after exerting mental effort.
But even preregistered studies often fail to find effects of exerting effort
on behavioral performance in the laboratory or elucidate the underlying
psychology. We tested a new paradigm in four preregistered within-subjects
studies (N = 686). An initial high-demand task reliably elicited very strong
effort phenomenology compared with a low-demand task. Afterward, participants
completed a Stroop task. We used drift-diffusion modeling to obtain the
boundary (response caution) and drift-rate (information-processing speed)
parameters. Bayesian analyses indicated that the high-demand manipulation
reduced boundary but not drift rate. Increased effort sensations further
predicted reduced boundary. However, our demand manipulation did not affect
subsequent inhibition, as assessed with traditional Stroop behavioral
measures and additional diffusion-model analyses for conflict tasks. Thus,
effort exertion reduced response caution rather than inhibitory control,
suggesting that after exerting effort, people disengage and become
uninterested in exerting further effort.
