<h2>
Proportion of Wearing over Time 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Displays the proportion of wearing over time among the daily profiles. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wear.time.plot(PA, label, flag, mark.missing = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PA</code></td>
<td>

<p>an N by T matrix including activity counts, where N is the total number of daily profiles, and T is the total minutes of a day (T=1440).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>

<p>an N by 2 matrix including the labels corresponding to <code>PA</code> matrix. The first column, <code>label[,1]</code>, includes the person id, and the second column, <code>label[,2]</code>, includes the day label of 1 to 7, indicating Sunday to Saturday.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>flag</code></td>
<td>

<p>an N by T matrix with the values of either 1 or 0 which indicating wearing or missing. This matrix can be created from <code>create.flag()</code>. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mark.missing</code></td>
<td>

<p>If <code>mark.missing = 0</code> (default), the nonwearing time is marked by 0 while the wearing time is marked by 1 in flag matrix. If <code>mark.missing = 1</code>, it is the opposite.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Plot with the proportion of wearing in y-axis and the time index in x-axis, also displaying the standard measurement day.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>By looking at the plot, we may decide the standard measurement day, which is the time range that exhibits the sufficiently large portion of wearing (60 or 70 percent).
