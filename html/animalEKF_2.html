<h2>
Extended Kalman Filters for Animal Movement
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>Synthetic generation of 1-D and 2-D correlated random walks (CRWs)
for animal movement with behavioral switching, and particle filter estimation
of movement parameters from observed trajectories using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) model.
See Ackerman (2018)<br><a href="https://digital.library.temple.edu/digital/collection/p245801coll10/id/499150">https://digital.library.temple.edu/digital/collection/p245801coll10/id/499150</a>.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. Mario Espinoza and co-authors for providing the shark observation data that inspired this work, and for allowing it to be included in this package.  I am
especially grateful to Dr. Espinoza for many discussions regarding the nuances of modeling animal movement, particularly for suggesting the idea of behavioral switching models.
</p>
<p>I am grateful to my doctoral thesis advisors, Dr. Marc Sobel, Dr. Richard Heiberger, and Dr. Mike O'Connor for supervising my research in this topic.  I am particularly grateful to 
Dr. Heiberger for his many hours in advising me on package design and on the <code>shiny</code> simulations in this package.
