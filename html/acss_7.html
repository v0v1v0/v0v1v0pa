<h2>Data from Experiment 1 in Gauvrit, Singmann, Soler-Toscano &amp; Zenil</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>34 participants were asked to produce at their own pace a series of 10 symbols among "A", "B", "C", and "D" that would "look as random as possible, so that if someone else sees the sequence, she will believe it is a truly random one".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">exp1
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame with 34 rows and 2 variables.</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Gauvrit, Singmann, Soler-Toscano &amp; Zenil (submitted). Complexity for psychology. A user-friendly implementation of the coding theorem method.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# load data
data(exp1)

# summary statistics
nrow(exp1)
summary(exp1$age)
mean(exp1$age)
sd(exp1$age)

## Not run: 
# this uses code from likelihood_d() to calculate the mean complexity K
# for all strings of length 10 with alphabet = 4:
tmp &lt;- acss_data[nchar(rownames(acss_data)) == 10, "K.4", drop = FALSE]

t.test(acss(exp1$string, 4)[,"K.4"], mu = mean_K)

## End(Not run)
