<h2>COUP: X-ray source variability</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset consists of three time series representing (in)homogeneous Poisson processes. They are tables of arrival times of individual X-ray photons from magnetically flaring young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, obtained from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP; Getman et al. 2005). NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is described at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory</a>.  COUP detected 1616 X-ray sources, mostly flaring young stars.  The first source, COUP 263, has 209 photon arrival times that appear to represent a constant X-ray intensity.  The second source, COUP 551, has 678 photons and exhibits at least two flares.  The third source, COUP 554, is much stronger with 14,258 photons; it exhibits very high-amplitude, nearly continuous flaring.  The dataset has three columns: the source identifier, the photon arrival time, and the photon X-ray energy. Gaps in the data streams due to the satellite observatory orbit have been removed. Photon energy may also represent a time dependent process as flares typically have higher average energy X-rays than quiescent periods. The dataset is discussed at <a href="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/Chandra_flares.html">http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/Chandra_flares.html</a>.  This dataset is useful for statistical methods treating event data and inhomogeneous Poisson processes.
