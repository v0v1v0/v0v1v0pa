<h2>Memory erasing data with covariate</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment from Chapter 16 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage:
"Thirty-six participants with ID chips were tested individually. All participants met a stranger who had a 5-minute scripted conversation with
them containing 10 critical pieces of information. A week later, the participants were asked to recall the encounter for 5 minutes, and then after
a 10-minute break wrote everything that they could remember about the original encounter. During the 5-minute initial recall, one of three things
happened: the control group (N = 12) received no intervention; the erase group (N = 12) had a pulse of electricity sent to their brain via their
ID chip; and the replace group (N = 12) had conflicting verbal descriptions sent to their ID chip. The outcome was how many of the 10 critical
pieces of information the participants wrote down after the recall phase."
