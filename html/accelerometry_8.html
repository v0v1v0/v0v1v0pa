<h2>Physical Activity Intensities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a vector of accelerometer count values, calculates time spent in 5 
mutually exclusive user-defined intensity levels (typically representing
sedentary, light, lifestyle, moderate, and vigorous) as well as the total 
counts accumulated in various intensities. Non-wear time should be removed 
from <code>counts</code> before calling <code>intensities</code> to avoid overestimating 
sedentary time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">intensities(counts, int_cuts = as.integer(c(100, 760, 2020, 5999)))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>counts</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer vector with accelerometer count values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>int_cuts</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector with four cutpoints from which five intensity 
ranges are derived. For example, <code>int_cuts = c(100, 760, 2020, 5999)</code> 
creates: 0-99 = intensity 1; 100-759 = intensity level 2; 760-2019 = 
intensity 3; 2020-5998 = intensity 4; &gt;= 5999 = intensity 5.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Integer vector of length 16 in which the first eight values are 
minutes in intensities 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2-3, 4-5, and 2-5, and the next eight 
are counts accumulated during time spent in each of those intensities.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Load accelerometer data for first 5 participants in NHANES 2003-2004
data(unidata)

# Get data from ID number 21005
counts.part1 &lt;- unidata[unidata[, "seqn"] == 21005, "paxinten"]

# Create vector of counts during valid wear time only
counts.part1.wear &lt;- counts.part1[weartime(counts = counts.part1) == 1]

# Calculate physical activity intensity variables
intensity.variables &lt;- intensities(counts = counts.part1.wear)
