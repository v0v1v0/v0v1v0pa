<h2>Parse POSIXct or Date objects from input data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These function use the Boost Date_Time library to parse
datetimes (and dates) from strings, integers, factors or even numeric values
(which are cast to strings internally). They return a vector of
<code>POSIXct</code> objects (or <code>Date</code> objects in the case of <code>anydate</code>).
<code>POSIXct</code> objects represent dates and time as (possibly
fractional) seconds since the ‘epoch’ of January 1, 1970.
A timezone can be set, if none is supplied ‘UTC’ is set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">anytime(x, tz = getTZ(), asUTC = FALSE,
  useR = getOption("anytimeUseRConversions", FALSE),
  oldHeuristic = getOption("anytimeOldHeuristic", FALSE),
  calcUnique = FALSE)

anydate(x, tz = getTZ(), asUTC = FALSE,
  useR = getOption("anytimeUseRConversions", FALSE), calcUnique = FALSE)

utctime(x, tz = getTZ(), useR = getOption("anytimeUseRConversions", FALSE),
  oldHeuristic = getOption("anytimeOldHeuristic", FALSE),
  calcUnique = FALSE)

utcdate(x, tz = getTZ(), useR = getOption("anytimeUseRConversions", FALSE),
  calcUnique = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of type character, integer or numeric with date(time)
expressions to be parsed and converted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string with the timezone, defaults to the result of the (internal)
<code>getTZ</code> function if unset. The <code>getTZ</code> function returns the timezone
values stored in local package environment, and set at package load time. Also
note that this argument applies to the <em>output</em>: the returned object will
have this timezone set. The timezone is <em>not</em> used for the parsing which
will always be to localtime, or to UTC is the <code>asUTC</code> variable is set (as
it is in the related functions <code>utctime</code> and <code>utcdate</code>).
So one can think of the argument as ‘shift parsed time object to this
timezone’. This is similar to what <code>format()</code> in base R does, but our
return value is still a <code>POSIXt</code> object instead of a character value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>asUTC</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating if parsing should be to UTC; default
is false implying localtime.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useR</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating if conversion should be done via code
from R (via <code>Rcpp::Function</code>) instead of the default Boost routines. The
default value is the value of the option <code>anytimeUseRConversions</code> with a
fallback of <code>FALSE</code> if the option is unset. In other words, this will
be false by default but can be set to true via an option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>oldHeuristic</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value to enable behaviour as in version 0.2.2 or earlier:
interpret a numeric or integer value that could be seen as a YYYYMMDD as a date. If
the default value <code>FALSE</code> is seen, then numeric values are used as offsets
dates (in <code>anydate</code> or <code>utcdate</code>), and as second offsets for datetimes
otherwise. A default value can also be set via the <code>anytimeOldHeuristic</code> option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>calcUnique</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value with a default value of <code>FALSE</code> that tells the
function to perform the <code>anytime()</code> or <code>anydate()</code> calculation only once for
each unique value in the <code>x</code> vector. It results in no difference in inputs or
outputs, but can result in a significant speed increases for long vectors where each
timestamp appears more than once. However, it will result in a slight slow down for
input vectors where each timestamp appears only once.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A number of fixed formats are tried in succession. These include
the standard ISO format ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’ as well as
different local variants including several forms popular in the
United States.  Two-digits years and clearly ambigous formats such
as ‘03/04/05’ are ignored.  In the case of parsing failure
a <code>NA</code> value is returned.
</p>
<p>Fractional seconds are supported as well.  As R itself only supports
microseconds, the Boost compile-time option for nano-second resolution
has not been enabled.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of <code>POSIXct</code> elements, or, in the case of <code>anydate</code>,
a vector of <code>Date</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>By default, the (internal) conversion to (fractional) seconds since the epoch is
relative to the locatime of this system, and therefore not completely
independent of the settings of the local system. This is to strike a
balance between ease of use and functionality.  A more-full featured
conversion could be possibly be added with support for arbitrary
reference times, but this is (at least) currently outside the scope of
this package. See the <span class="pkg">RcppCCTZ</span> package which offers some
timezone-shifting and differencing functionality. As of version 0.0.5 one
can also parse relative to UTC avoiding the localtime issue,
</p>
<p>Times and timezones can be tricky. This package offers a heuristic approach,
it is likely that some input formats may not be parsed, or worse, be parsed
incorrectly. This is not quite a <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">Bobby Tables</a>
situation but care must always be taken with user-supplied input.
</p>
<p>The Boost Date_Time library cannot parse single digit months or
days. So while ‘2016/09/02’ works (as expected),
‘2016/9/2’ will not. Other non-standard formats may also
fail.
</p>
<p>There is a known issue (discussed at length in
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/5">issue
ticket 5</a>) where Australian times are off by an hour. This seems
to affect only Windows, not Linux.
</p>
<p>When given a vector, R will coerce it to the type of the first
element. Should that be <code>NA</code>, surprising things can
happen: <code>c(NA, Sys.Date())</code> forces both values to
<code>numeric</code> and the date will not be parsed correctly (as its
integer value becomes numeric before our code sees it). On the
other hand, <code>c(Sys.Date(), NA)</code> works as expected parsing as
type Date with one missing value. See
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/11">issue
ticket 11</a> for more.
</p>
<p>Another known issue concerns conversion when the timezone is set
to ‘Europe/London’, see GitHub issue tickets
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/36">36</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/51">51</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/59">59</a>. and
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/86">86</a>. As
pointed out in the comment in that last one, the
<code>Sys.timezone</code> manual page suggests several
alternatives to using ‘Europe/London’ such as ‘GB’.
</p>
<p>Yet another known issue arises on Windows due to designs in the
Boost library. While we can set the <code>TZ</code> library variable,
Boost actually does <em>not</em> consult it but rather relies only
on the (Windows) tool <code>tzutil</code>. This means that default
behaviour should be as expected: dates and/or times are parsed to
the local settings.  But testing different <code>TZ</code> values (or
more precisely, changes via the (unexported) helper function
<code>setTZ</code> function as we cache <code>TZ</code>) will only influence
the behaviour on Unix or Unix-alike operating systems and not on
Windows.  See the discussion at
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime/issues/96">issue
ticket 96</a> for more. In short, the recommendation for Windows
user is to also set <code>useR=TRUE</code> when setting a timezone
argument.
</p>


<h3>Operating System Impact</h3>

<p>On Windows systems, accessing the <code>isdst</code> flag on dates or times
before January 1, 1970, can lead to a crash. Therefore, the lookup of this
value has been disabled for those dates and times, which could therefore be
off by an hour (the common value that needs to be corrected).
It should not affect dates, but may affect datetime objects.
</p>


<h3>Old Heuristic</h3>

<p>Up until version 0.2.2, numeric input smaller than an internal cutoff value
was interpreted as a date, even if <code>anytime()</code> was called.  While
convenient, it is also inconsistent as we otherwise take numeric values to
be offsets to the epoch. Newer version are consistent: for <code>anydate</code>, a
value is taken as <em>date offset</em> relative to the epoch (of January 1, 1970).
For <code>anytime</code>, it is taken as <em>seconds offset</em>. So <code>anytime(60)</code>
is one minute past the epoch, and <code>anydate(60)</code> is sixty days past it.
The old behaviour can be enabled by setting the <code>oldHeuristic</code> argument to
<code>anytime</code> (and <code>utctime</code>) to <code>TRUE</code>.  Additionally, the default
value can be set via <code>getOption("anytimeOldHeuristic")</code> which can be set
to <code>TRUE</code> in startup file. Note that all other inputs such character,
factor or ordered are not affected.
