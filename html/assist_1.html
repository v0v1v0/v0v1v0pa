<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>acid</code> data frame has 112 rows and 4 columns of data derived based on the Eastern Lakes Survey of 1984 implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency of the USA.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(acid)
</code></pre>

</p>
<p>x1, x2 numeric vectors of the lakes' geographic locations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>112 lakes are extracted in the southern Blue Ridge mountains area. The surface pH values were recorded together with the calcium concentration and geographic locations.</p>
