<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ADMUR: Ancient Demographic Modelling Using Radiocarbon
</p>
<p>Tools to directly model underlying dynamics of radiocarbon date datasets using a Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPL) model framework, or Summed Probability Distributions (SPD) within a simulation framework. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Package to model population dynamics from anthropogenic datasets of dates, including radiocarbon dates and other date such as thermoluminescence. Provides tools to perform two modelling approaches:
</p>
<p>1. Summed Probability Distribution generation, and simulation testing. Permits the rejection of a null hypothesis.
</p>
<p>2. Directly models the underlying population dynamics using a Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPL) model framework. 
</p>
<p>The CPL model framework includes tools to: Estimate the dates and magnitude of demographic events (hinge points), both the Maximum likelihood (using DEoptimR search algorithm) and Credible Intervals (using MCMC Metropolis Hastings Algorithm); Perform Goodness of Fit tests; perform model comparison.
</p>
