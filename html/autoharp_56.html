<h2>Checks if a graph is connected.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A tree is a graph that is connected but does not have any cycles. This
function checks if a provided adjacency list is connected.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">is_connected(adj_list, root = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>adj_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>The adjacency list of the tree.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>root</code></td>
<td>
<p>The root node to start checking from. This defaults to the
first node in the adjacency list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is used as one of the validity checks within the
definition of the TreeHarp class. It is a low-level function, not really
meant for the general user of the package. Hence it is not exported.
</p>
<p>The nodes are traversed in a BFS order. The function could actually be
combined with is_cyclic_r, but it is kept separate for modularity
reasons.
</p>
<p>An alternative was to convert the list to an adjacency matrix and check
for a row and column of zeros.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a TRUE if the graph is connected and FALSE
otherwise.
</p>
