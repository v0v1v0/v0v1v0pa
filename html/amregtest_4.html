<h2>Example 3 Marginal quality data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is sample data copied from allelematch::amExampleData in version 5.2.1
of package allelematch. We use this data to test allelematch backwards compatibility.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with samples in rows, and alleles in columns. Missing data is represented as "-99".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data in this example have been simulated to represent a data set of marginal
quality where the use of allelematch combined with careful manual review of the
results is required to achieve a confident assessment of the unique genotypes. At each
locus a random 4% of heterozygotes lost their second allele to simulate an allele dropout,
and a random 10% of samples at each locus had alleles set to missing.
