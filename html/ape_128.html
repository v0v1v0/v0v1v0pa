<h2>Concensus Trees</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a series of trees, this function returns the consensus tree. By
default, the strict-consensus tree is computed. To get the
majority-rule consensus tree, use <code>p = 0.5</code>. Any value between
0.5 and 1 can be used.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">consensus(..., p = 1, check.labels = TRUE, rooted = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>either (i) a single object of class <code>"phylo"</code>, (ii) a
series of such objects separated by commas, or (iii) a list
containing such objects.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value between 0.5 and 1 giving the proportion for a
clade to be represented in the consensus tree.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check.labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical specifying whether to check the labels
of each tree. If <code>FALSE</code> (the default), it is assumed that all
trees have the same tip labels, and that they are in the same order
(see details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rooted</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical specifying whether the trees should be treated as
rooted or not.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Using <code>check.labels = FALSE</code> results in
considerable decrease in computing times. This requires that all
trees have the same tip labels, <em>and</em> these labels are
ordered similarly in all trees (in other words, the element
<code>tip.label</code> are identical in all trees).
</p>
<p>Until <span class="pkg">ape</span> 5.6-2, the trees passed to this function were
implicitly treated as rooted, even when the option <code>rooted =
  FALSE</code> was used. This is now fixed (see PR65 on GitHub) so that, by
default, the trees are explicitly treated as unrooted (even if
<code>is.rooted</code> returns <code>TRUE</code>). Thus, it could
be that results now differ from previous analyses (setting
<code>rooted = TRUE</code> might help to replicate previous results).

<p>an object of class <code>"phylo"</code>.
