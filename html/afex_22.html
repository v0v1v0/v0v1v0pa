<h2>Replication of Laptop Note Taking Study (Urry et al. 2021, Psych. Science)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Original abstract: 
In this direct replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer’s (2014) Study 1,
participants watched a lecture while taking notes with a laptop (n = 74) or
longhand (n = 68). After a brief distraction and without the opportunity to
study, they took a quiz. As in the original study, laptop participants took
notes containing more words spoken verbatim by the lecturer and more words
overall than did longhand participants. However, laptop participants did not
perform better than longhand participants on the quiz.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Own description:
</p>
<p>Heather Urry and 87 of her undergraduate and graduate students (yes, all 87
students are co-authors!) compared the effectiveness of taking notes on a
laptop versus longhand (i.e., pen and paper) for learning from lectures. 142
participants (which differed from the 88 authors) first viewed one of several
15 minutes lectures (TED talks) during which they were asked to take notes
either on a laptop or with pen and paper. Participants were randomly assigned
to either the laptop (N = 68) or longhand condition (N = 74). After a 30
minutes delay, participants were quizzed on the content of the lecture. There
were two types of questions, factual and conceptual questions. The answers
from each participant were then independently rated from several raters
(which agreed very strongly with each other) using a standardised scoring key
producing one memory score per participant and questions type ranging from 0
(= no memory) to 100 (= perfect memory). We also aggregated the two different
scores into one overall memory score.
