<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools for simulating different methods of observing alternating renewal processes
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">ARPobservation</span> provides a set of tools for simulating data based on direct observation of behavior. 
It works by first simulating a behavior stream based on an alternating renewal process, using 
specified distributions of event durations and interim times. Different procedures for recording data 
can then be applied to the simulated behavior stream. 
</p>
<p>The main function for simulating a behavior stream is <code>r_behavior_stream</code>. Currently, the event
duration and interim time distributions must come from the class <code>eq_dist</code>. (See the documentation
for this class for distributions that are currently implemented.) 
</p>
<p>Several different observation recording procedures can then be applied as filters to a simulated behavior stream. 
The following procedures are currently implemented:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>continuous_duration_recording</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>momentary_time_recording</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>event_counting</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>interval_recording</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply multiple procedures to the same behavior stream, use <code>reported_observations</code>. Data can also
be simulated using the convenience functions <code>r_PIR</code>, <code>r_WIR</code>, <code>r_MTS</code>,
<code>r_continuous_recording</code>, and <code>r_event_counting</code>. These functions wrap the 
behavior-stream generation step and the observation recording step into a single function. They are more 
memory efficient, but slightly less computationally efficient, than executing each step in turn.
