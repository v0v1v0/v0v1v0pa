<h2>ADMM : Algorithms using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An introduction of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method has been a breakthrough in
solving complex and non-convex optimization problems in a reasonably stable as well as scalable fashion.
Our package aims at providing handy tools for fast computation on well-known problems using the method.
For interested users/readers, please visit Prof. Stephen Boyd's <a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html">website</a>
entirely devoted to the topic.
