<h2>Temperature Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Central England mean yearly temperatures from 1659 to 1976
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A ts tmpyr
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Hosking notes that while the ARFIMA(1, d, 1) has a lower AIC, it is not much
lower than the AIC of the ARFIMA(1, d, 0).
</p>
<p>Bhansali and Kobozka find: muHat = 9.14, d = 0.28, phi = -0.77, and theta =
-0.66 for the ARFIMA(1, d, 1), which is close to our result, although our
result reveals trimodality if <code>numeach</code> is large enough.  The third
mode is close to Hosking's fit of an ARMA(1, 1) to these data, while the
second is very antipersistent.
</p>
<p>Our package gives a very close result to Hosking for the ARFIMA(1, d, 0)
case, although there is also a second mode.  Given how close it is to the
boundary, it may or may not be spurious.  A check with <code>dmean = FALSE</code>
shows that it is not the optimized mean giving a spurious mode.
</p>
<p>If, however, we use <code>whichopt = 1</code>, we only have one mode.  Note that
Nelder-Mead sometimes does take out non-spurious modes, or add spurious
modes to the surface.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">

data(tmpyr)

fit &lt;- arfima(tmpyr, order = c(1, 0, 1), numeach = c(3, 3), dmean = TRUE, back=TRUE)
fit
##suspect that fourth mode may be spurious, even though not close to a boundary
##may be an induced mode from the optimization of the mean

fit &lt;- arfima(tmpyr, order = c(1, 0, 1), numeach = c(3, 3), dmean = FALSE, back=TRUE)

##perhaps so


plot(tacvf(fit), maxlag = 30, tacf = TRUE)

fit1

fit2 &lt;- arfima(tmpyr, order = c(1, 0, 0), dmean = FALSE, back=TRUE)
fit2  ##still bimodal.  Second mode may or may not be spurious.

fit3 &lt;- arfima(tmpyr, order = c(1, 0, 0), dmean = FALSE, whichopt = 1, numeach = c(3, 3))
fit3  ##Unimodal.  So the second mode was likely spurious.

plot(tacvf(fit2), maxlag = 30, tacf = TRUE)
##maybe not spurious.  Hard to tell without visualizing the surface.

##compare to plotted tacf of fit1:  looks alike
plot(tacvf(fit1), maxlag = 30, tacf = TRUE)

tacfplot(list(fit1, fit2))
