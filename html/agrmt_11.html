<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function reduces a vector to a frequency vector. This function is very similar to the way <code>table</code> summarizes vectors, but this function can deal with categories of frequency 0 if the argument <code>pos</code> is specified. Here we assume a vector with an entry for each individual (the order of the values is ignored). Each entry states the position of an individual. When the number of positions is naturally limited, such as when categorical positions are used, frequency vectors can summarize this information: how many individuals have position 1, how many individuals have position 2, etc. A frequency vector has an entry for each position in the population (sorted in ascending order). Each entry states the number of individuals in the population with this position.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>pos</code> is required if certain positions do not occur in the population (or if there is a chance that they do not occur in a specific sub-population). For example, if we have positions on a 7-point scale, and position 3 never occurs in the population, the argument <code>pos</code> must be specified. In this case, the argument may be <code>pos=1:7</code>. We can also use categories more generally, as in <code>c(-3, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5)</code>. Specifying the positions of categories when all positions occur in the population has no side-effects. See the example for an illustration.
</p>
<p>By default, missing values (NA) are removed with <code>as.numeric(na.omit())</code>. This helps with some vectors that include NA that fail otherwise. If NA are maintained with <code>na.rm=FALSE</code>, they are included as the last category. The argument <code>pos</code> cannot include NA as a position; NA are removed if the argument <code>pos</code> is used.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">V = c(1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,5,5)
# summarize using table()
table(V)
# summarize using collapse()
collapse(V)
# assuming possible values (1,2,3,4,5), we get that zero times 2 included:
collapse(V, pos=c(1,2,3,4,5))
