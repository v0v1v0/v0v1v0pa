<h2>anovir: Analysis of Virulence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Epidemiological population dynamics models traditionally define a
pathogen's virulence as the increase in the per capita rate of mortality
of infected hosts due to infection.
The ANOVIR package provides functions allowing virulence to be estimated
by maximum likelihood techniques.
The approach is based on the analysis of relative survival applied to
the comparison of survival in matching cohorts of experimentally-infected
vs. uninfected hosts (Agnew 2019).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The analysis of relative survival is a statistical method for estimating
excess mortality.
Excess mortality occurs when a target population experiences greater
mortality than would be expected for a given period of time.
Here excess mortality is estimated in the context of emprical studies
where survival in populations of experimentally infected hosts is
compared to that in matching populations of uninfected, or control, hosts.
In this context the relative survival approach assumes the
rate of mortality observed in the infected treatment arises as the sum of
two independent and mutually exclusive sources of mortality,
(i) the 'natural' or background rate of mortality, and
(ii) an addition rate of mortality due to infection.
</p>
<p>The background rate of mortality is the expected rate of mortality hosts in
the infected treatment would have experienced had they not been
exposed to infection; it is estimated from mortality
observed in the matching uninfected control treatment.
When there is background mortality, the rate of mortality of infected
hosts due to infection is not directly observed;
however it can be estimated from the difference in mortality observed
for an infected treatment and that observed in a matching control treatment.
</p>
<p>The two sources of mortality assumed in the relative survival approach,
and the additive effect of their rates for infected hosts, is also found
in the population dynamics models on which most epidemiological theory
is based.
The additional rate of mortality of infected hosts due to
infection is generally how these models define pathogen virulence.
