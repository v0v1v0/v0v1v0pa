<h2>A large data set comprising the end of imaging data from a chick pea experiment conducted in high-throughput greenhouses</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data collected after imaging  had been completed on the 1056 plants in the experiment reported by Atieno et al. (2017). The design employed for the experiment was a split-plot design in which two consecutive carts formed a main plot. The split-plot design assigned 245 genotypes to main plots, the genotypes being unequally replicated 2 or 3 times. Treatments (non-saline, saline) were randomized to the two subplots (carts) within each main plot. 
</p>
<p>The columns in the <code>data.frame</code> are: Smarthouse, Lane, Position, Zone, Mainplot, Subplot, Replicate, xLane, xPosition, Genotypes, Treatments, Biomass, PlantHeight, SenescenceRank, TotalPods, FilledPods, EmptyPods, SeedNo, TotalSeedWt, SeedWt100.   
</p>
<p>The columns Smarthouse, Lane and Position uniquely identify the rows of observations. Zones are groups of 4 Lanes, Mainplots are the 44 pairs of consecutive Subplots within each Zone, and a Subplot is a cart containing a single plant. The columns xLane and xPosition are numeric covariates for location within a Smarthouse. Genotypes and Treatments indicate the genotype and treatment that each plant was allocated.  The response variables are Biomass, PlantHeight, SenescenceRank, TotalPods, FilledPods, EmptyPods, SeedNo, TotalSeedWt and SeedWt100.
