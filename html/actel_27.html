<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check if the dependencies required to open a GUI are installed, and if
opening a GUI does not throw an error. Some code adapted from RGtk2's
.onLoad function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkGUI(GUI = c("needed", "always", "never"), save.tables.locally)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>GUI</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of "needed", "always" or "never". If "needed", a new window is
opened to inspect the movements only if the movements table is too big to be
displayed in R's console. If "always", a graphical interface is always created
when the possibility to invalidate events emerges. If "never", a graphical
interface is never invoked. In this case, if the table to be displayed does
not fit in R's console, a temporary file will be saved and the user will be
prompted to open and examine that file. Defaults to "needed".</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An updated GUI argument (character string)
