<h2>Discriminate between beta-sharing clones and dual-alpha TCR clones (optimized
for common clones)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>dual_top()</code> distinguishes between clones that share a common beta
chain and dual TCR clones with two productive alpha chains. The procedure
calculates the likelihood that two (alpha, beta) pairs (with common a beta
chain) come from two distinct clones sharing the same beta chain vs the
likelihood that the two pairs derive from a dual TCR-alpha clone.
A significant difference between the two likelihoods is indicative of a
dual alpha clone, and these clones are returned as dual clones.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix recording which alpha chains appear in each well of the
data. See <code>create_data</code>.</p>
</td>

<td><code>beta</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix recording which beta chains appear in the each well of the
data. See <code>create_data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pair</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix where each row is a beta/alpha pair, column 1 and 2 are
the beta indices, and column 3 and 4 are the alpha indices, and column 5
is the proportion of replicates the clone was found in (or equal to -1 if
the clone is dual)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>error</code></td>
<td>
<p>The mean error "dropped" chain rate due to PCR or sequencing
errors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numb_cells</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cells per well in each column of the plates.
Should be a vector of 12 elements.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of dual-alpha clones, where col 1 and 2 are beta indices of
the clone (which should be equal) and col 3 and 4 are alpha indices of the
clone (which are different).
