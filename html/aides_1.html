<h2>aides: Additive Information &amp; Details of Evidence Synthesis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>aides</em>, an R package, has been proposed to be a useful collection of
functions designed to offer supplementary information and intricacies in data
synthesis and evidence evaluation. Essentially, package <em>aides</em> serves
as an aiding toolkit for pooled analysis of aggregated data, crafted with a
vision to support a more inclusive and informed approach to evidence-based
decision-making; and it is developed with values on flexibility, ease of use,
and comprehensibility. Package <em>aides</em> will be updated with advances of
methodology of data synthesis and evidence evaluation. The initial goals are
to simplify analysis process for both professionals and public users, and to
support them in navigating the complexities of synthesized evidence. Long-term
goal of package <em>aides</em> is to support knowledge translation and decision-making
based on the obtained information with comprehensive understanding of the
evidence.
</p>
<p>Package <em>aides</em> is currently is developed using <b>R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt)</b>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Current version consists of eight functions, including four functions for
examining fundamental assumptions before test of small-study effects (i.e.
function <code>PlotDistrSS</code>, <code>TestDisparity</code>, <code>PlotDisparity</code>, and <code>TestDiscordance</code>)
and four functions for performing sequential-method-related analyses (i.e. <code>DoSA</code>, <code>DoOSA</code>,
<code>PlotOSA</code>, and <code>PlotPower</code>).
