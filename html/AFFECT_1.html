<h2>Accelerated Functional Failure Time Model with Error-Contaminated Survival Times</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package AFFECT, referred to Accelerated Functional Failure time model with Error-Contaminated survival Times,
aims to recover the functional covariates under accelerated functional failure time models, where the data are
subject to error-prone response and misclassified censoring status. This package primarily
contains three functions. <code>data_gen</code> is applied to generate artificial data based on accelerated functional
failure time models, including potential covariates, error-prone response and misclassified censoring status.
<code>ME_correction</code> is used to do correction for error-prone response variable and misclassified censoring
status, and <code>Boosting</code> is used to recover the functional covariates under accelerated functional failure time models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AFFECT()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package aims to estimate functional covariates under an AFT models with error-prone response and
and misclassified censoring status. The strategy is to derive an unbiased estimating function by the Buckley-James
estimator with measurement error in response and misclassification in censoring status being corrected.
Finally. the functional covariates as well as informative covariates under an AFT models can be derived by
the boosting procedure.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No return value, called for side effects.
