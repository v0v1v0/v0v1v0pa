<h2>Memory erasing data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment:
"Thirty-six participants with ID chips were tested individually. All participants met a stranger who had a 5-minute scripted conversation with
them containing 10 critical pieces of information. A week later, the participants were asked to recall the encounter for 5 minutes, and then after
a 10-minute break wrote everything that they could remember about the original encounter. During the 5-minute initial recall, one of three things
happened: the control group (N = 12) received no intervention; the erase group (N = 12) had a pulse of electricity sent to their brain via their
ID chip; and the replace group (N = 12) had conflicting verbal descriptions sent to their ID chip. The outcome was how many of the 10 critical
pieces of information the participants wrote down after the recall phase."
The data are taken from Chapter 16 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage.
