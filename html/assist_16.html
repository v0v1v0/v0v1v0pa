<h2>Coronary Ainus Potassium Concentrations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>dog</code> data frame has 252 rows and 4 columns of data considered by Grizzle and Alen (1969)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(dog)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data frame contains the following columns:
</p>
<p>y a numeric vector of meansurements of coronary sinus postassium concentrations.
</p>
<p>group a vector of group index for the four groups of dogs.
</p>
<p>dog a vector of integers identifying dogs.
</p>
<p>time a numeric vector of time points measurements were made.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are coronary sinus potassium concentrations measured on each of 36 dogs. These 36 dogs were divided into 4 treatment groups, and the measurements on each dog were taken every two minutes from 1 to 13 minutes after occlusion.</p>
