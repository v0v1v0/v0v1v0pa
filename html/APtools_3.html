<h2>Comparison of two risk scores based on the differences and ratio of their APs.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function estimates the difference between and the
ratio of two APs in order to compare two markers for
censored time to event data or binary data. The
corresponding confidence intervals are provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  CompareAP(status, marker1, marker2, stime = NULL,
    t0.list = NULL, method = "none", alpha = 0.95,
    B = 1000, weight = NULL, Plot = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>status</code></td>
<td>
<p>Binary indicator. For binary data, 1
indicates case and 0 otherwise. For survival data, 1
indicates event and 0 otherwise.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>marker1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Risk score 1 (to be compared to risk score
2). Its length is required to be the same as the length
of status.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>marker2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Risk score 2 (to be compared to risk score
1). Its length is required to be the same as the length
of status.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stime</code></td>
<td>
<p>Censored event time. If dealing with binary
outcome, skip this argument which is set to be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t0.list</code></td>
<td>
<p>Prediction time intervals of interest for
event time outcome. It could be one numerical value or a
vector of numerical values, which must be in the range of
stime. It is set to be NULL if stime is NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Method to obtain confidence intervals. The
default is method = "none", in which case only point estimates will be given without confidence intervals.
If method= "perturbation", then perturbation based CI will be calculated.
If method = "bootstrap", then nonparametric bootstrap based CI will be calculated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Confidence level. The default level is
0.95.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of resampling for obtaining a confidence
interval. The default value is 1000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional argument for event time data, i.e.
stime is not NULL. Its default value is NULL, in which
the observations are weighted by the inverse of the
probability that their respective time-dependent event
status (whether the event occurs within a specified time
period) is observed. In estimating the probability, the
survival function of the censoring time is estimated by a
Kaplan-Meier estimator under the assumption that the
censoring time is independent of both the event time and
risks score. Users can use their own weights, in which
case the t0.list should be a scalar and the length of
weight is required to be the same as the length of
status.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional argument for event time data, i.e.
stime is not NULL. For binary data, it is set to FALSE.
For event time data, its default value is TRUE and three
plots are generated: 1) the time-dependent AUC of two
markers; 2) the time-dependent AP of two markers; and 3)
the time-dependent ratio of APs, all versus the
prediction time intervals. The quantities in 1)-3) are
evaluated at the time points which partition the range of
the event times of the data to 100 intervals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dap_summary</code></td>
<td>
<p>Summary of the APs of two markers and the
differences (AP1-AP2) and their ratio (AP1/AP2). For
event time data, these quantities are estimated at the
specified prediction time intervals. The output includes
the estimated event rate/proportion of cases, point
estimates of the APs of the two markers, point estimates
of the difference between and ratio of the two APs as
well as their respective confidence intervals.</p>
