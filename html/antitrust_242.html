<h2>Methods For Calculating Own and Cross-Price Elasticities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the own and cross-price elasticity between any two products in the market.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'Cournot'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'Linear'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'Logit'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'LogLin'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'AIDS'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'LogitNests'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'CES'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'CESNests'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'VertBargBertLogit'
elast(object, preMerger = TRUE, market = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of one of the classes listed above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preMerger</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, calculates pre-merger price elasticities. If
FALSE, calculates post-merger price elasticities. Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>market</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, calculates the market (aggregate) elasticity. If
FALSE, calculates matrix of own- and cross-price elasticities. Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When ‘market’ is FALSE, this method computes the matrix
of own and cross-price elasticities. Element i,j of this matrix is
the percentage change in the demand for good i from a small change in
the price of good j. When ‘market’ is TRUE, this method computes the
market (aggregate) elasticities using share-weighted prices.
</p>
<p>When ‘preMerger’ is TRUE, elasticities are
calculated at pre-merger equilibrium prices and shares, and when ‘preMerger’ is FALSE, they
are calculated at post-merger equilibrium prices and shares.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a k x k matrix of own- and cross-price elasticities,
where k is the number of products in the market.
