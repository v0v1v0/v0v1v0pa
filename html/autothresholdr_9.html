<h2>Stack-thresholded image class.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A stack-thresholded array is an array which has had stack-thresholding
applied to it. See <code>mean_stack_thresh()</code>. It has 3 necessary attributes:
</p>
 <ul>
<li> <p><code>thresh</code> is the threshold that was applied. This is either a
number or an object of class th. Values in the original array which were
less than this value are deemed to have failed the thresholding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fail_value</code> is the value to which elements of the array which failed the
thresholding were set. This could be something like <code>0</code> or <code>NA</code>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>stack_thresh_method</code> details which stacked-thresholding method was employed;
this is either <code>"mean"</code> or <code>"median"</code>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">stack_threshed_img(img, thresh, fail_value, stack_thresh_method)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

ijtiff_img (indexed by <code>img[y, x, frame]</code>).</p>
