<h2>Blood samples from an athlete convicted of doping.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the result of the analysis of 13 blood samples,
taken over a period of 5 years, of a female athlete who was convicted
of doping on the basis of the Athlete Biological Passport.

</dl>
<p>In November 2012, the athlete was convicted of doping by the Court
of arbitration for Sport, the evidence showing at least two occurences
of doping, in summer 2009 (shortly before the test of 2 July 2009) and
in June 2011, likely using an agent such as recombinant erythropoietin
(rhEPO).
</p>
<p>Doping is indicated in particular by high haemoglobin values associated
with very low reticulocyte % and high OFF scores (a combination of these
two variables).</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The data tables published in the original source
contain several typos, as confirmed by the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA). In particular, values for RETP in rows 8 and 10
were swapped and the MCHC value for row 7 was incorrect. This
package's source code contains both the original data and the
details of the corrections that were applied.
</p>
<p>The ABPS values provided are very close (within &lt;2%) to those
obtained using the <code>ABPS</code> function, but some of them were likely
calculated using different (older) versions of the ABPS code, which
may explain some of these differences.
