<h2>
Approximate stochastic simulation algorithm
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements adaptive tau-leaping approximation for simulating the
trajectory of a continuous-time Markov process (see reference below).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ssa.adaptivetau(init.values, transitions, rateFunc, params, tf,
                jacobianFunc = NULL, maxTauFunc = NULL,
                deterministic = NULL, halting = NULL,
                relratechange = rep(1, length(init.values)),
                tl.params = NULL, reportTransitions = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init.values</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of initial values for all variables.  This should be a simple
one-dimensional vector of real numbers.  <em>IMPORTANT:</em> variables
must never take negative values.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transitions</code></td>
<td>

<p>One of two possible data types:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A list with length equal to the number of transitions.  Each
element of the list should be a vector specifying a transition
(i.e., which state(s) change and by how much).  Each entry in the
vector needs a name (specifying which state variable to change,
either by name or index) and a value (specifying the amount by
which this variable will change).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A two-dimensional matrix of integers specifying how each state
variable (rows) should be changed for a given transition (columns).
Generally this will be a sparse matrix of primarily 1s and -1s,
which can make this structure inefficient.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the example below for details as well as
<code>ssa.maketrans</code> or the vignette accompanying this package.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rateFunc</code></td>
<td>

<p>R function that returns instantaneous transition rates for each
transition in the form a real-valued one-dimensional vector with
length equal to the number of transitions.  The order of these
rates must match the order in which transitions were specified in
the <code>transitions</code> parameter above.  This function must accept
the following arguments:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> vector of current values for all state variables (in order
used in the <code>init.values</code> argument above)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> parameters as supplied in argument to ssa.adaptivetau
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> single real number giving the current time (all simulations
start at t=0)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>params</code></td>
<td>

<p>any R variable to be passed as-is to rateFunc, presumably specifying
useful parameters.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tf</code></td>
<td>

<p>final time of simulation.  Due to the approximate nature of the
tau-leaping algorithm, the simulation may overshoot this time somewhat.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jacobianFunc</code></td>
<td>
<p> R function that returns Jacobian of transition
rates.  If supplied, enables the use of the implicit tau-leaping
algorithm (if appropriate; used in stiff systems).  In contrast to
typical definition of Jacobian (but consistent with the transition
matrix parameter above), columns represent transitions (functions)
and rows represent state variables (different partial derivative
variables). jacobianFunc takes the same parameters as rateFunc.
<b>NOTE:</b> the implicit tau-leaping algorithm will reduce the observed
variance for fast-changing state variables, although the mean will
be correct.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxTauFunc</code></td>
<td>
<p> R function that returns single real number giving
the maximum time step allowable from the current state.  Only
called if the adaptive tau algorithm wants to leap in a step
greater than tl.params$maxtau value. Takes same parameters as
rateFunc.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deterministic</code></td>
<td>

<p>Specify transitions to be treated as deterministic.  If not NULL,
either a TRUE/FALSE vector of length equal to the number of
transitions -or- a integer vector of transition numbers to be
treated as deterministic (i.e. applying <code>which</code> to the
former).  Deterministic transitions will be applied every timestep
using the <b>expected</b> degree of change.  Note this will almost
certainly result in non-integer values for any affected state
variables.  Also, note that this is still an approximation – not a
true numerical ODE solution – and at least one transition must be
stochastic for this to work at all.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>halting</code></td>
<td>

<p>Specify transitions which, when executed, will cause the simulation
to halt.  If not NULL, either a TRUE/FALSE vector of length equal to the
number of transitions -or- a integer vector of transition numbers to
be treated as halting (i.e. applying <code>which</code> to
the former).  If halting transitions are specified, then the return
value is different (since we want to know which transition halted us).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relratechange</code></td>
<td>

<p>one-dimensional vector of length equal to the number of state
variables providing an upperbound to the ratio of amount that any
transition rate will change given a corresponding change in the
state variable.  In other words, if variable i doubles, can we be
assured that no transition will <b>more</b> than double (ratio of
1)?  If not, then you need to set this variable to be greater than 1.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tl.params</code></td>
<td>

<p>Parameters to the tau-leaping algorithm itself (epsilon and delta
are best explained by reading the original reference):
</p>

<dl>
<dt>epsilon</dt>
<dd>
<p>default 0.05; increasing will make bigger leaps
resulting in potentially more error</p>
</dd>
<dt>delta</dt>
<dd>
<p>default 0.05; how close two symmetric transition
rates must be before we classify them as in
partial-equilibrium.  Only applies to the implicit tau routine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>maxtau</dt>
<dd>
<p>default Inf; maximum time step allowed.  Should only need
to specify if rate functions are drastically non-smooth or if your
rate function explictly depends on time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>extraChecks</dt>
<dd>
<p>default TRUE; whether to perform a battery of
validity checks on the state variables and rates after every
call to "rateFunc."  Slows down implementation, but unless
you are SURE you have designed your transition matrix and rate
function correctly, probably best to keep these checks.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reportTransitions</code></td>
<td>
<p>default FALSE; whether to include a
matrix of executed transitions per time interval in the output
(alongside with the states at each time point).
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The initial values, transition matrix &amp; transition rates must all be
designed such that variables are always non-negative.  The algorithm
relies on this invariant.
</p>
<p>See reference for details but, in brief the adaptive tau-leaping
algorithm dynamically switches between three methods for simulating
events:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>exact</dt>
<dd>
<p>no approximation – executes a single transition at a time</p>
</dd>
<dt>explicit tau-leaping</dt>
<dd>
<p>subdivides transitions into those that
might hit cause a variable to hit 0 (“critical”) and those
that do not.  Duration of time step picked dynamically with the
goal of maximizing the step while minimized the change in the
transition rates (the approximation assumes that these rates do
not change).  Non-critical transitions are advanced by a
poisson-distributed random variable; critical transitions are
handled more like the exact algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>implicit tau-leaping</dt>
<dd>
<p>in addition to dividing between critical
and non-critical, also identifies transitions in quasi-equilbrium
(reversible pairs of transition that have roughly equal
forward-backward flow).  Duration of time step picked on basis of
non-critical, non-equilibrium transitions.  This has the potential
to greatly increase the timestep size for stiff systems.  Similar
idea to the explicit method but necesitates solving an implicit
equation via Newton's method.  Thus you must supply a function to
calculate the Jacobian to enable this method.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All error messages that reference variables or transitions by number
use 1-based numbering where the first variable (or transition) is 1.
</p>
<p>Consider calling <code>enableJIT(1)</code> before running
ssa.adaptivetau.  In most circumstances, this should yield some
speedup by byte-code compiling the rate function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If no halting transitions are specified, then a two-dimensional matrix
with rows for every timepoint at which the rateFunc was evaluated and
columns giving the value for every state variable at that time.  The
first column specifies the time.
</p>
<p>If halting transitions are specified, then a list with two elements.
The first (‘dynamics’) is the same two-dimensional matrix as
without halting transitions.  The second (‘haltingTransition’)
gives the number of the transition that halted the simulation, or NA
otherwise.
</p>
<p>If the ‘reportTransitions’ option is used, then a list is
returned with two elements (or three, if combined with halting
transitions).  The final element of the list is a two-dimensional
matrix called ‘transitions’ with a row for each timepoint and
columns giving the number of times each transition was executed in the
between the current time and the previous time.

## Simple Lotka-Volterra example

# We have three potential transitions:

           x["prey"]*x["pred"]*params$eat,  # rate of predation
