<h2>Converting between formats</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions <code>toWide()</code>, <code>toLong()</code>, <code>toCompiled()</code>
<code>toRaw()</code> and <code>toTabular()</code>
converts the data into various formats.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">toWide(w)

toLong(w)

toCompiled(w)

toRaw(w)

toTabular(w)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of an ANOFA object.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The classification of a set of $n$ participants can be
given using many formats. One basic format (called <code>wide</code> herein)
has $n$ lines, one per participants, and category names assigned
to each.
Another format (called <code>compiled</code> herein) is to have a list of all
the categories and the number of participants falling in each
cells. This last format is typically much more compact (if there
are 6 categories, the data are all contained in six lines).
However, we fail to see each individual contributing to the counts.
See the vignette DataFormatsForFrequencies for more.
A third possible format (called <code>raw</code> herein) put one column per
category and 1 is the observation matches this category, 0 otherwise.
This format results in $n$ lines, one participants, and as many
columns are there are categories.
Lastly, a fourth format (called <code>long</code> herein) as, on a line, the
factor name and the category assigned in that factor. If there are
$f$ factors and $n$ participants, the data are in $f*n$ lines.

<p>See the vignette DataFormatsForFrequencies for more.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data frame in the requested format.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# The minimalExample contains $n$ of 20 participants categorized according
# to two factors $f = 2$, namely `Intensity` (three levels) 
# and Pitch (two levels) for 6 possible cells.
minimalExample

# Lets incorporate the data in an anofa data structure
w &lt;- anofa( Frequency ~ Intensity * Pitch, minimalExample )

# The data presented using various formats looks like
toWide(w)
# ... has 20 lines ($n$) and 2 columns ($f$)

toLong(w)
# ... has 40 lines ($n \times f$) and 3 columns (participant's `Id`, `Factor` name and `Level`)

toRaw(w)
# ... has 20 lines ($n$) and 5 columns ($2+3$)

toCompiled(w)
# ... has 6 lines ($2 \times 3$) and 3 columns ($f$ + 1)

toTabular(w)
# ... has one table with $2 \times 3$ cells. If there had been
# more than two factors, the additional factor(s) would be on distinct layers.
