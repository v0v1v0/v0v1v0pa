<h2>Ratings for 96 words</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A stimulus set that was used in experiments by Schaper, Kuhlmann and
Bayen (2019a; 2019b). The item pool consists of 96 German words. 
Each word represents an object that is either 
typically found in a bathroom or in a kitchen.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<dt>room</dt>
<dd>
<p>The room in which the item is typically found; can be
'kitchen' or 'bathroom'</p>
