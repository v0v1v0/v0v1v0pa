Data from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey MHB for European Crossbill from 2001 to 2012
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Swiss breeding bird survey ("Monitoring Häufige Brutvögel" MHB) has monitored the populations of approximately 150 common species since 1999. The MHB sample consists of 267 1-km squares that are laid out as a grid across Switzerland. Fieldwork is conducted by about 200 skilled birdwatchers annually, most of them volunteers. Avian populations are monitored using a simplified territory mapping protocol (also called spot-mapping West of the Atlantic), where each square is surveyed up to three times during the breeding season (only twice above the tree line around 2000 m elevation). Surveys are conducted along a transect that does not change over the years and is 4-6 kms in length on average.
</p>
<p>The data frame <code>crossbillAHM</code> has the data for European Crossbill (<em>Loxia curvirostra</em>)  from 2001 to 2012.
</p>
<p>A variant of this data set for 1999 to 2007 only is included in package <span class="pkg">unmarked</span>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("crossbillAHM")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>crossbillAHM</code> is a data frame with 267 rows and 77 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>coordx, coordy </dt>
<dd>
<p>the x and y coordinates of the center of the quadrat; the coordinate reference system intentionally not specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt>elev </dt>
<dd>
<p>the mean elevation of the quadrat, m.</p>
</dd>
<dt>forest </dt>
<dd>
<p>percentage forest cover</p>
</dd>
<dt>nsurveys </dt>
<dd>
<p>the number of replicate surveys <em>planned</em> in the quadrat; above the tree-line 2, otherwise 3.</p>
</dd>
<dt>det011 to det123 </dt>
<dd>
<p>1 if the species was detected in the quadrat, 0 otherwise; NA if the corresponding survey was not carried out; the first 2 digits indicate the year and the 3rd digit the survey.</p>
</dd>
<dt>date011 to date123 </dt>
<dd>
<p>Julian date of the survey, 1 = 1st January; the first 2 digits indicate the year and the 3rd digit the survey; NA if the corresponding survey was not carried out.</p>
</dd>
