<h2>Data from the German Reiseanalyse survey</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset from the
<a href="https://reiseanalyse.de/en/">Reiseanalyse survey</a> comprises travel
information on German travelers between 1971 and 2018. Data were collected
in a yearly repeated cross-sectional survey of German pleasure travels,
based on a sample representative for the (West) German citizens (until 2009)
or for all German-speaking residents (starting 2010). Travelers from former
East Germany are only included since 1990. Note that the sample only contains
trips with at least five days of trip length. For details see
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354816620987198">Weigert et al. (2021)</a>.
