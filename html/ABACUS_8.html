<h2>Shiny App to Demonstrate Two-Sample Independent (Unpaired) Student's t-Test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An interactive Shiny app to demonstrate two-sample independent (unpaired) Student's t-test.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">shiny_twosampt()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The interactive Shiny app demonstrates the principles of the hypothesis testing of means
in a two-sample independent (unpaired) design where the population variances are equal but unknown.
The true parameter values are provided by the user.
The user changes sample characteristics, distribution function and simulation features
and explores the influence of these changes on the hypothesis testing using Student's t-test.
</p>
<p>The left panel includes the user inputs for <strong>Simulation Features</strong>, <strong>Population Parameters</strong>,
<strong>Sample Characteristics</strong>, and <strong>Distribution Function</strong>.
To use the app at first instance, just click the <code>Update</code> button.
To alter the input values, edit the text box or move the point on the slider and
explore the changes in different tabs (see below).
</p>
<p>To obtain identical outcomes in a separate run of the app,
set a common seed value at the bottom of the left panel and click <code>Update</code>.
All subsequent updates will produce identical results provided other inputs are identical.
The seed value is ignored when the option <code>check the box to update instantly</code> is selected.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The outcomes are presented in several tabs.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Population</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the density plots of two populations and
rug plots of the sample units sample units randomly drawn from these populations.
It also includes the population parameter values chosen by the user.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sample</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the dot plots and box plots of two samples drawn
randomly from the two populations and rug plots of the sample units.
It also includes the mean and standard deviation of two random samples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Test Statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the plots showing the mean difference between two groups
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).
The tab also contains a panel of the distribution of the test statistic <code>t</code>
with the observed value of the test statistic and probabilities under the given value of the Type 1 error</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Summary</code></td>
<td>
<p>includes the summary of the sampled data and outcomes
from the one-sample Student's t-test. Different sections are:
(1) Hypothesis, highlighting the null and alternative hypothesis;
(2) Sample, tabulating the full sampled data;
(3) Summary Statistics, summarising the summary information of two samples;
(4) Test Statistic, presenting the outputs from independent two-sample Student's t-test.
(5) Confidence Interval, highlighting the mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).</p>
