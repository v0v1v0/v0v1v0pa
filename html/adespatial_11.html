<h2>Class For Constrained Hiereachical Clustering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Files belonging to this class hold information about the constrained
agglomerative clustering and allows one to display results graphically.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A file belonging to this class is a list with elements:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>merge</dt>
<dd>
<p>A (n-1) by 2 matrix. Row i of file <code>"merge"</code> describes
the merging of clusters at step i of the clustering. If an element j in
the row is negative, it means that observation -j was merged at this
stage. If j is positive, it means that the merge was with the cluster
formed at the (earlier) stage j of the algorithm. Thus negative entries
in file <code>"merge"</code> indicate agglomerations of singletons, and
positive entries indicate agglomerations of non-singletons.</p>
</dd>
<dt>height</dt>
<dd>
<p>A set of (n-1) non-decreasing real values. The clustering
height is the value of the criterion associated with the clustering
method for the particular agglomeration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>order</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector giving the permutation of the original observations
suitable for plotting, in the sense that a cluster plot using this ordering
and matrix merge will not have crossing branches.</p>
</dd>
<dt>labels</dt>
<dd>
<p>Labels for the clustered objects.</p>
</dd>
<dt>method</dt>
<dd>
<p>The agglomerative clustering method that has been used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>call</dt>
<dd>
<p>The call that produced the result.</p>
</dd>
<dt>dist.method</dt>
<dd>
<p>The distance that has been used to create dissimilarity
matrix <code>"d"</code> (only returned if the dissimilarity matrix object has a
"method" attribute attached to it).</p>
</dd>
<dt>links</dt>
<dd>
<p>A copy of the list of edges (if a matrix of edges was provided
to the function).</p>
</dd>
<dt>coords</dt>
<dd>
<p>A copy of the coordinates (if coordinates were provided to the
function).</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The class inherits from <code>hclust-class</code> and describes the
tree produced by the constrained clustering procedure.
</p>
<p>All class members except <code>links</code> and <code>coords</code> are identical to
those in <code>hclust-class</code>. several methods designed to process
these objects are expected to also work with <code>constr.hclust-class</code>
objects.
