<h2>The adephylo package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is devoted to exploratory analysis of phylogenetic comparative
data. It re-implements and extends phylogenetic procedures from the
<code>ade4</code> package (which are now deprecated).<br></p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Comparative data (phylogeny+traits) are handled as phylo4d
objects, a canonical class implemented by the <code>phylobase</code> package.
Trees are handled as <code>phylo</code> objects (from the
<code>ape</code> package) or as phylo4 objects (<code>phylobase</code>'s
extension of <code>phylo</code> objects).<br></p>
<p>Main functionalities of <code>adephylo</code> are summarized below.<br></p>
<p>=== TOPOLOGICAL INFORMATION ===<br> Several functions allow one to retrieve
topological information from a tree; such information can be used, for
instance, as a basis to compute distances or proximities between tips.<br></p>
<p>- <code>listDD</code>: lists the direct descendants from each node of a
tree.<br></p>
<p>- <code>listTips</code>: lists the tips descending from each node of a
tree.<br></p>
<p>- <code>.tipToRoot</code>: finds the set of nodes between a tip and the
root of a tree.<br></p>
<p>- <code>sp.tips</code>: finds the shortest path between tips of a tree.<br></p>
<p>- <code>treePart</code>: defines partitions of tips reflecting the topology
of a tree. This function can output non-independent dummy vectors, or
alternatively an orthonormal basis used by the orthogram procedure.<br></p>
<p>=== PHYLOGENETIC PROXIMITIES/DISTANCES ===<br> Several phylogenetic
proximities and distances are implemented. Auxiliary function easing the
computation of other distances/proximities are also provided:<br></p>
<p>- <code>distRoot</code>: computes different distances of a set of tips to
the root.<br></p>
<p>- <code>distTips</code>: computes different pairwise distances in a set of
tips.<br></p>
<p>- <code>proxTips</code>: computes different proximities between a set of
tips.<br></p>
<p>=== MEASURES/TESTS OF PHYLOGENETIC AUTOCORRELATION ===<br> Several procedures
allow one to measure, and/or test phylogenetic signal in biological
traits:<br></p>
<p>- <code>abouheif.moran</code>: performs Abouheif's test, designed to detect
phylogenetic autocorrelation in a quantitative trait. This implementation is
not based on original heuristic procedure, but on the exact formulation
proposed by Pavoine et al. (2008), showing that the test is in fact a
Moran's index test. This implementation further extends the procedure by
allowing any measure of phylogenetic proximity (5 are proposed).<br></p>
<p>- <code>orthogram</code>: performs the orthonormal decomposition of
variance of a quantitative variable on an orthonormal basis as in Ollier et
al. (2005). It also returns the results of five non parametric tests
associated to the variance decomposition.<br></p>
<p>- <code>moran.idx</code>: computes Moran's index of autocorrelation given a
variable and a matrix of proximities among observations (no test).<br></p>
<p>=== MODELLING/INVESTIGATION OF PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL ===<br> Rather than
testing or measuring phylogenetic autocorrelation, these procedures can be
used for further investigation of phylogenetic signal. Some, like
<code>me.phylo</code>, can be used to remove phylogenetic autocorrelation.
Others can be used to understand the nature of this autocorrelation (i.e.,
to ascertain which traits and tips are concerned by phylogenetic
non-independence).<br></p>
<p>- <code>me.phylo</code>/<code>orthobasis.phylo</code>: these synonymous
functions compute Moran's eigenvectors (ME) associated to a tree. These
vectors model different observable phylogenetic signals. They can be used as
covariables to remove phylogenetic autocorrelation from data.<br></p>
<p>- <code>orthogram</code>: the orthogram mentioned above also provides a
description of how biological variability is structured on a phylogeny.<br></p>
<p>- <code>ppca</code>: performs a phylogenetic Principal Component Analysis
(pPCA, Jombart et al. 2010). This multivariate method investigates
phylogenetic patterns in a set of quantitative traits.<br></p>
<p>=== GRAPHICS ===<br> Some plotting functions are proposed, most of them being
devoted to representing phylogeny and a quantitative information at the same
time.<br></p>
<p>- <code>table.phylo4d</code>: fairly customisable way of representing
traits onto the tips of a phylogeny. Several traits can be plotted in a
single graphic.<br></p>
<p>- <code>bullseye</code>: an alternative to <code>table.phylo4d</code>
based on fan-like representation, better for large trees.<br></p>
<p>- <code>scatter.ppca</code>, <code>screeplot.ppca</code>,
<code>plot.ppca</code>: several plots associated to a phylogenetic
principal component analysis (see <code>ppca</code>).<br></p>
<p>=== DATASETS ===<br> Several datasets are also proposed. Some of these
datasets replace former version from <code>ade4</code>, which are now deprecated.
Here is a list of available datasets: <code>carni19</code>,
<code>carni70</code>, <code>lizards</code>, <code>maples</code>,
<code>mjrochet</code>, <code>palm</code>, <code>procella</code>,
<code>tithonia</code>, and <code>ungulates</code>.<br></p>
