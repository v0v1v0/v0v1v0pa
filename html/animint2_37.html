<h2>
The breakpointError of simulated signals
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two noisy signals were sampled from a latent signal with known
breakpoints, which were used to measure the error of estimated
models with 1,...,20 segments.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(breakpoints)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of 5 data.frames: error contains the breakpointError of the
estimated models, signals contains the noisy signals, breaks contains
the breakpoints in the estimated signals, segments contains the
estimated segments, and imprecision contains the normalized imprecision
curves which were used to evaluate the error.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The breakpointError package was used to measure the model error, see
etc/breakpoints.R.
