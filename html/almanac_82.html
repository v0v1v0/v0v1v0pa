<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Weekly rules are a bit tricky because they are implemented to comply
# with ISO-8601 standards, which require that the first week of the year
# is when there are at least 4 days in that year, and the week starts on
# the week day specified by `recur_with_week_start()` (Monday by default).
