<h2>Convert date to a an arbitrary week definition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert date to a an arbitrary week definition
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">date2week(
  x,
  week_start = get_week_start(),
  floor_day = factor,
  numeric = FALSE,
  factor = FALSE,
  ...
)

week2date(x, week_start = get_week_start(), floor_day = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a Date, POSIXt, character, or any data that can be easily
converted to a date with <code>as.POSIXlt()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>week_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number indicating the start of the week based on the ISO
8601 standard from 1 to 7 where 1 = Monday OR an abbreviation of the
weekdate in an English or current locale. <em>Note: using a non-English locale
may render your code non-portable.</em> Defaults to the value of
<code>get_week_start()</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>floor_day</code></td>
<td>
<p>when <code>TRUE</code>, the days will be set to the start of the week.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numeric</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, only the numeric week be returned. If <code>FALSE</code>
(default), the date in the format "YYYY-Www-d" will be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factor</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, a factor will be returned with levels spanning the
range of dates. This should only be used with <code>floor_day = TRUE</code> to
produce the sequence of weeks between the first and last date as the
factor levels.  Currently, <code>floor_date = FALSE</code> will still work, but will
produce a message indicating that it is deprecated. <em>Take caution when
using this with a large date range as the resulting factor can contain all
days between dates</em>.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments passed to <code>as.POSIXlt()</code>, unused in all other cases.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Weeks differ in their start dates depending on context. The ISO
8601 standard specifies that Monday starts the week
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date</a>) while the US CDC uses
Sunday as the start of the week
(<a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/22305">https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/22305</a>). For
example, MSF has varying start dates depending on country in order to
better coordinate response.
</p>
<p>While there are packages that provide conversion for ISOweeks and epiweeks,
these do not provide seamless conversion from dates to epiweeks with
non-standard start dates. This package provides a lightweight utility to
be able to convert each day.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>date2week()</code> an aweek object which represents dates in
<code>YYYY-Www-d</code> format where <code>YYYY</code> is the year (associated with the week,
not necessarily the day), <code>Www</code> is the week number prepended by a "W" that
ranges from 01-53 and <code>d</code> is the day of the week from 1 to 7 where 1
represents the first day of the week (as defined by the <code>week_start</code>
attribute).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>week2date()</code> a Date object.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>date2week()</code> will initially convert the input with <code>as.POSIXlt()</code> and
use that to calculate the week. If the user supplies character input, it
is expected that the input will be of the format yyyy-mm-dd <em>unless</em> the
user explicitly passes the "format" parameter to <code>as.POSIXlt()</code>. If the
input is not in yyyy-mm-dd and the format parameter is not passed,
<code>date2week()</code> will result in an error.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## Dates to weeks -----------------------------------------------------------

# The same set of days will occur in different weeks depending on the start
# date. Here we can define a week before and after today

print(dat &lt;- as.Date("2018-12-31") + -6:7)

# By default, the weeks are defined as ISO weeks, which start on Monday
print(iso_dat &lt;- date2week(dat))

# This can be changed by setting the global default with set_week_start()

set_week_start("Sunday")

date2week(dat)

# If you want lubridate-style numeric-only weeks, you need look no further
# than the "numeric" argument
date2week(dat, numeric = TRUE)

# To aggregate weeks, you can use `floor_day = TRUE`
date2week(dat, floor_day = TRUE)

# If you want aggregations into factors that include missing weeks, use
# `floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE`:
date2week(dat[c(1, 14)], floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE)


## Weeks to dates -----------------------------------------------------------

# The aweek class can be converted back to a date with `as.Date()`
as.Date(iso_dat)

# If you don't have an aweek class, you can use week2date(). Note that the
# week_start variable is set by the "aweek.week_start" option, which we will
# set to Monday:

set_week_start("Monday")
week2date("2019-W01-1") # 2018-12-31

# This can be overidden by the week_start argument;
week2date("2019-W01-1", week_start = "Sunday") # 2018-12-30

# If you want to convert to the first day of the week, you can use the 
# `floor_day` argument
as.Date(iso_dat, floor_day = TRUE)

## The same two week timespan starting on different days --------------------
# ISO week definition: Monday -- 1
date2week(dat, 1)
date2week(dat, "Monday")

# Tuesday -- 2
date2week(dat, 2)
date2week(dat, "Tuesday")

# Wednesday -- 3
date2week(dat, 3)
date2week(dat, "W") # you can use valid abbreviations

# Thursday -- 4
date2week(dat, 4)
date2week(dat, "Thursday")

# Friday -- 5
date2week(dat, 5)
date2week(dat, "Friday")

# Saturday -- 6
date2week(dat, 6)
date2week(dat, "Saturday")

# Epiweek definition: Sunday -- 7 
date2week(dat, 7)
date2week(dat, "Sunday")
