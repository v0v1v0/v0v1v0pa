<h2>Define a truncation selection policy for early termination of HyperDrive runs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Truncation selection cancels a given percentage of lowest performing runs at
each evaluation interval. Runs are compared based on their performance on the
primary metric and the lowest X% are terminated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">truncation_selection_policy(
  truncation_percentage,
  evaluation_interval = 1L,
  delay_evaluation = 0L
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>truncation_percentage</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer of the percentage of lowest
performing runs to terminate at each interval.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>evaluation_interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer of the frequency for applying policy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delay_evaluation</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer of the number of intervals for which to
delay the first evaluation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>TruncationSelectionPolicy</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This policy periodically cancels the given percentage of runs that rank the
lowest for their performance on the primary metric. The policy strives for
fairness in ranking the runs by accounting for improving model performance
with training time. When ranking a relatively young run, the policy uses the
corresponding (and earlier) performance of older runs for comparison.
Therefore, runs aren't terminated for having a lower performance because they
have run for less time than other runs.
</p>
<p>The truncation selection policy takes the following configuration parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>truncation_percentage</code>: An integer of the percentage of lowest performing
runs to terminate at each evaluation interval.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>evaluation_interval</code>: Optional. The frequency for applying the policy.
Each time the training script logs the primary metric counts as one
interval.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>delay_evaluation</code>: Optional. The number of intervals to delay the
policy evaluation. Use this parameter to avoid premature termination
of training runs. If specified, the policy applies every multiple of
<code>evaluation_interval</code> that is greater than or equal to <code>delay_evaluation</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when evaluating a run at a interval N, its performance is only
compared with the performance of other runs up to interval N even if they
reported metrics for intervals greater than N.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># In this example, the early termination policy is applied at every interval
# starting at evaluation interval 5. A run will be terminated at interval 5
# if its performance at interval 5 is in the lowest 20% of performance of all
# runs at interval 5
## Not run: 
early_termination_policy = truncation_selection_policy(
                                                 truncation_percentage = 20L,
                                                 evaluation_interval = 1L,
                                                 delay_evaluation = 5L)

## End(Not run)
