<h2>“Calculating Prices” Methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For Auction2ndCap, the calcPrices method computes the expected price that the buyer pays,
conditional on the buyer purchasing from a particular firm.
</p>
<p>For Logit, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is Logit and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.
</p>
<p>For LogitCap, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium shares under the assumptions that
consumer demand is Logit and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game with capacity constraints.
</p>
<p>For Logit, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is Logit and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.
</p>
<p>For LogLin, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is Log-Linear and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.
</p>
<p>For AIDS, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is AIDS and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.
It returns a length-k vector of NAs if the user did not supply prices.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of the respective class (see description for the classes)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preMerger</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the pre-merger ownership structure is used. If FALSE, the post-merger ownership structure is used.
Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exAnte</code></td>
<td>
<p>If ‘exAnte’ equals TRUE then the
<em>ex ante</em> expected result for each firm is produced, while FALSE produces the
expected result conditional on each firm winning the auction. Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>isMax</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, a check is run to determine if the calculated equilibrium price vector locally maximizes profits.
Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded. Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>For Logit, additional values that may be used to change the
default values of <code>BBsolve</code>, the non-linear equation solver.
</p>
<p>For others, additional values that may be used to change the default values of <code>constrOptim</code>, the non-linear
equation solver used to enforce non-negative equilibrium quantities.</p>
