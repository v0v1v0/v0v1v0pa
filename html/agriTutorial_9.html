<h2>Rice data for Example 3</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>(Gomez &amp; Gomez, 1984, p. 401): Nitrogen uptake (g/pot) of rice was studied in a two-factor
greenhouse experiment involving duration of water stress (W) and level of nitrogen application (N).
The experiment had four water-stress levels (0, 10, 20 and 40 days) as main-plot treatments and
four nitrogen rates (0, 90, 180 and 270 kg/ha) as sub-plot treatments. The main plots were
randomized in four complete blocks.
