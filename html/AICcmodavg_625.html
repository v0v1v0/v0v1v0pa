Newt Capture-mark-recapture Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a capture-mark-recapture data set on adult male and female
Red-spotted Newts (<em>Notophthalmus viridescens</em>) recorded by Gill
(1985).  A total of 1079 unique individuals were captured in pitfall
traps at a breeding site (White Oak Flat pond, Virginia) between 1975
and 1983.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A single cohort of individuals was followed throughout the study, as all
individuals were marked in 1975 and no new individuals were added during
the subsequent years.  This data set is used to illustrate classic
Cormack-Jolly-Seber and related models (Cormack 1964, Jolly 1965, Seber
1965, Lebreton et al. 1992, Mazerolle 2015).

##organize as a data frame readable by RMark package (Laake 2013)
##RMark requires at least one column called "ch" 
##and another "freq" if summarized captures are provided
