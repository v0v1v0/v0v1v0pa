<h2>Normalizes a matrix.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Normalizes a count matrix X for correspondence analysis and returns
the corresponding metric. The normalization for X is as follows:
First the row sums of X are computed, giving the weights for each
sample. These weights are stored in a matrix D, which defines an
inner product on the columns of X. Then the vectors of counts
stored in the rows of X are replaced with proportions, and the
resulting matrix is centered according to the inner product defined
by D. Both the centered data matrix and D are returned to the user.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>The matrix to be normalized.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the normalized matrix (<code>Xtilde</code>) and the
row weights (<code>D</code>).
