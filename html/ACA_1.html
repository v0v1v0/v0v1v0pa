<h2>Dataset amorese.data.txt</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is a small simulated time series to test the <code>ACA</code> 
package.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data set contains 2 columns. The first column is an index, 
from 1 to 410. The second column are the values of a synthetic 
combination of normal distributions. This is a modified version of the 
data example from James &amp; Mattesons (2014) study: a sequence of 100 
independent samples from normal distributions (N(0, 1), N(0, 3), N(2, 1) 
and N(2, 4)). The notation N(??, ??) means normally distributed 
with mean ?? and standard deviation ??. This synthetic data set is 
slighty upgraded by adding an extra N(0, 3) very short (10 samples) 
segment at the end of the initial sequence. This extra tip is added in 
order to assess the detection capability for a breakpoint close to 
series??? end, where an edge effect may be significant. Moreover, a 5 per 
cent slope is added to this synthetic series to simulate a series with 
upward trend. This synthetic series is plotted in Figures 2b and 2d in 
Amorese &amp; al. (2018).</p>
