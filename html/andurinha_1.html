<h2>andurinha: Tools to make spectroscopic data processing easier</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains a set of functions that makes
spectroscopic data processing easier and faster. It is intended for
processing several spectra (tens to hundreds) of samples with similar
composition. It compiles spectroscopy data files, produces standardised and
second derivative spectra, finds peaks and allows to select the most
significant ones based on the second derivative/absorbance sum spectrum. It
also provides functions for graphic evaluation of the outputs.

<h3>andurinha functions</h3>


<ol>
<li> <p><code>importSpectra</code>: in case you have your spectra in
separated files (.csv) this function imports and bind them in a single data
frame.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>findPeaks</code>: finds peaks and allows to select the most
relevant based on the second derivative sum spectrum.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gOverview</code>: generates a graphic overview of the
spectroscopic data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>plotPeaks</code>: makes a graphic representation of the
peaks over the second derivative/absorbance sum spectrum.
