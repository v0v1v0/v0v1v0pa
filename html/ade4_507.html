<h2>Phylogeny and quantitative traits of flowers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set describes the phylogeny of 11 flowers as reported by Morales (2000). It also gives morphologic and demographic traits corresponding to these 11 species.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(tithonia)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>tithonia</code> is a list containing the 2 following objects :
</p>
  
<dl>
<dt>tre</dt>
<dd>
<p>is a character string giving the phylogenetic tree in Newick format.</p>
</dd> 
<dt>tab</dt>
<dd>
<p>is a data frame with 11 species and 14 traits (6 morphologic traits and 8 demographic).</p>
</dd>    
</dl>
