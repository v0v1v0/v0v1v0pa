<h2>Returns an example of <code>AM_mcmc_fit</code> output produced by the univariate Gaussian model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows us to generate a sample output of fitting the univariate gaussian model. No arguments are needed to be passed.
The purpose of this function is to serve as a demo for users to understand the model's output, without diving too deep into details. By default,
this demo generates a sample dataset of dimension 500x1, where the MCMC sampler is specified to run for 2000 iterations, with a burn-in of 1000, and a thinning interval of 10. All possible outputs
that can be produced by <code>AM_mcmc_fit</code> are returned (see return value below).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AM_demo_uvn_poi()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the following items:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the vector (or matrix) containing the synthetic data used to fit the model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the vector containing the final cluster assignment of each observation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> an <code>AM_mcmc_output</code> object, which is the typical output of <code>AM_mcmc_fit</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
