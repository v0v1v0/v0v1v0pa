<h2> Solubility Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set that contains information about compounds used in drug discovery. 
Specifically, this data set consists of 5631 compounds on which an in-house
solubility screen (ability of a compound to dissolve in a water/solvent mixture) was performed. 
</p>
<p>Based on this screen, compounds were categorized as either insoluble (n=3493) or soluble (n=2138).  
Then, for each compound, 72 continuous, noisy structural
descriptors were computed.  
</p>
