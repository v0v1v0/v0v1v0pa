Count data from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey for Green Woodpeckers from 2004 to 2017
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Swiss breeding bird survey ("Monitoring Häufige Brutvögel" MHB) has monitored the populations of approximately 150 common species since 1999. The MHB sample consists of 267 1-km squares that are laid out as a grid across Switzerland. Fieldwork is conducted by about 200 skilled birdwatchers annually, most of them volunteers. Avian populations are monitored using a simplified territory mapping protocol (also called spot-mapping West of the Atlantic), where each square is surveyed up to three times during the breeding season (only twice above the tree line around 2000 m elevation). Surveys are conducted along a transect that does not change over the years and is 4-6 kms in length on average.
</p>
<p>The data frame <code>greenWoodpecker</code> has count data for Green Woodpeckers <em>Picus viridis</em> from 2004 to 2017. There are some missing values: see Details.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Missing values in the <code>count</code> and <code>date</code> columns indicate that the corresponding survey was not carried out.
</p>
<p>On 26 occasions when surveys were carried out, the time taken was not recorded, resulting in additional NAs in the <code>time</code> columns.
