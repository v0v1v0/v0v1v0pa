<h2>Intersect expressions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes two or more SOP expressions (combinations of conjunctions and
disjunctions) or even entire minimization objects, and finds their intersection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">intersection(..., snames = "", noflevels)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more expressions, combined with / or minimization objects
of class <code>"QCA_min"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>snames</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string containing the sets' names, separated by commas.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>noflevels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numerical vector containing the number of levels for each set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The initial aim of this function was to provide a software implementation of the
intersection examples presented by Ragin (1987: 144-147). That type of example can also
be performed with the function <b><code>simplify()</code></b>, while this
function is now mainly used in conjunction with the <b><code>modelFit()</code></b>
function from package <b><span class="pkg">QCA</span></b>, to assess the intersection between theory and a
QCA model.
</p>
<p>Irrespective of the input type (character expressions and / or minimiation objects),
this function is now a wrapper to the main <b><code>simplify()</code></b>
function (which only accepts character expressions).
</p>
<p>It can deal with any kind of expressions, but multivalent crisp conditions need additional
information about their number of levels, via the argument <b><code>noflevels</code></b>.
</p>
<p>The expressions can be formulated in terms of either lower case - upper case notation
for the absence and the presence of the causal condition, or use the tilde notation
(see examples below). Usage of either of these is automatically detected, as long as all
expressions use the same notation.
</p>
<p>If the <b><code>snames</code></b> argument is provided, the result is sorted according to the order
of the causal conditions (set names) in the original dataset, otherwise it sorts the causal
conditions in alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>For minimzation objects of class <code>"QCA_min"</code>, the number of levels, and the set names are
automatically detected.
