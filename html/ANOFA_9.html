<h2>contrastFrequencies: contrasts analysis of frequency data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>contrastFrequencies()</code> performs contrasts analyses
of frequencies after an omnibus analysis has been obtained with <code>anofa()</code>
according to the ANOFA framework. See Laurencelle and Cousineau (2023) for more.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">contrastFrequencies(w = NULL, contrasts = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
<p>An ANOFA object obtained from <code>anofa()</code> or <code>emFrequencies()</code>;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>contrasts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list that gives the weights for the contrasts to analyze.
The contrasts within the list can be given names to distinguish them.
The contrast weights must sum to zero and their cross-products must equal 0
as well.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>contrastFrequencies computes the Gs for the contrasts,
testing the hypothesis that it equals zero.
The contrasts are each 1 degree of freedom, and the sum of the contrasts'
degrees of freedom totalize the effect being decomposed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a model fit of the constrasts.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Basic example using a two-factors design with the data in compiled format. 
# Ficticious data present frequency of observation classified according
# to Intensity (three levels) and Pitch (two levels) for 6 possible cells.
minimalExample

# performs the omnibus analysis first (mandatory):
w &lt;- anofa(Frequency ~ Intensity * Pitch, minimalExample) 
summary(w)

# execute the simple effect of Pitch for every levels of Intensity
e &lt;- emFrequencies(w, ~ Intensity | Pitch)
summary(e)

# For each Pitch, contrast the three intensities, first
# by comparing the first two levels to the third, second
# by comparing the first to the second level:
w3 &lt;- contrastFrequencies( e, list(
