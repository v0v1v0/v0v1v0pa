<h2>The Amiga File Format Handler package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Amiga File Format Handler package (AmigaFFH) is designed to interpret file formats that were native
to Commodore Amiga machines.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In combination with the adfExplorer package this package can be used to interpret older file formats that
were native to the Commodore Amiga. The focus of this package will be on the older system (Amiga OS &lt;= 3.0).
This will allow you to analyse and interpret these files in the scripted environment of R.
</p>
<p>Note that all functions and methods in this package are implemented as scripted source code and may not run
very fast.
</p>


<h3>Supported File Formats</h3>

<p>This package supports a number of file formats. The ProTracker module file format requires sophisticated interpretation
and a dedicated package (ProTrackR) is developed for that purpose.
</p>
<p>The following formats are supported by this package (to some extend):
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>Amiga Basic binary encode scripts and
Amiga Basic shapes which
were used by such scripts to display specific graphics.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Bitmap Font (.font). Originally fonts were stored in separate files on
the Amiga. An overarching '.font' file contained generic information,
amongst others the specific pixel heights that were available for a font.
The actual font bitmap images were stored in separate files. There
was a file available for each individual font height. For more details
see <code>AmigaBitmapFont()</code> and <code>AmigaBitmapFontSet()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Interchange File Format (IFF). This file format is actually a container for a wide variety of
data flavours. Of which the following are supported:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 8SVX (8-bit sampled voices (i.e., audio)). There are no major restrictions in this package's
implementation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ANIM (animations). Not all display modes are supported as per ILBM. Furthermore, the vertical byterun
encoding for the animation frames is the only encoding currently supported.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap images). Specific display modes (such as 'extra halfbrite') can in
some cases be decoded, but encoding for these modes may not (yet) be supported.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> For more details see <code>IFFChunk()</code>, <code>interpretIFFChunk()</code>, <code>read.iff()</code> and
<code>write.iff()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Hardware sprites. This format follows the hardware structure for displaying sprites on the screen.
It is usually not used
as a file format as such, but it can be found embedded in some files (for instance the mouse pointer
is embedded as a
hardware sprite in the 'system-configuration' file). For more details see <code>hardwareSprite()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> System-configuration. A file that was stored in the 'devs' directory of a system disk.
As the file name suggests, it holds many of the systems configurations. See SysConfig
for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Workbench icons (.info). Icons (i.e., graphical representation of files and directories
on the Amiga) were stored as separate files with the extension '.info'. See
<code>AmigaIcon()</code> for more details.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In future versions of this package more file types may be added to this list.
</p>


<h3>In Addition...</h3>

<p>Several helper functions are also exported by this package. This will give you access
to older compression techniques, such as the run length encoding (<code>packBitmap()</code>)
and delta Fibonacci compression (<code>deltaFibonacciCompress()</code>). But also other
techniques that will help in converting modern files into classic file formats and vice versa.
Such as for instance the function to <code>dither()</code> full colour images to a limited
colour palette.
