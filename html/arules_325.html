<h2>Association Rule Induction from Itemsets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides the generic function <code>ruleInduction()</code> and the method to induce all association
rules which can be generated by the given set of itemsets from a transactions
dataset.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ruleInduction(x, ...)

## S4 method for signature 'itemsets'
ruleInduction(
  x,
  transactions = NULL,
  confidence = 0.8,
  method = c("ptree", "apriori"),
  reduce = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the set of itemsets from which rules will be induced.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further arguments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transactions</code></td>
<td>
<p>the transactions used to mine the itemsets. Can
be omitted for method <code>"ptree"</code>,
if <code>x</code> contains a (complete set) of frequent itemsets
together with their support counts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>confidence</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the minimum confidence
threshold for the rules.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p><code>"ptree"</code> or <code>"apriori"</code></p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All rules that can be created using the supplied itemsets and that surpass the
specified minimum confidence threshold are returned.
<code>ruleInduction()</code> can be used to produce
closed association rules defined by Pei
et al. (2000) as rules <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠X =&gt; Y⁠</code> where both <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are
closed frequent itemsets. See the code example in the Example section.
</p>
<p>Rule induction implements several induction methods. The default method is <code>"ptree"</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"ptree"</code> <strong>method without transactions:</strong>
No transactions are need to be specified if
<code>x</code> contains a complete set of frequent or
itemsets. The itemsets' support counts are stored in a ptree and then retrieved to
create rules and calculate rules confidence. This is very fast,
but fails because of missing
support values if <code>x</code> is not a complete set of frequent itemsets.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"ptree"</code> <strong>method with transactions:</strong>
If transactions are specified then all transactions are counted into a prefix
tree and
later retrieved to create rules from the itemsets and calculate confidence values.
This is slower, but necessary if <code>x</code> is not a complete set of frequent itemsets.
To improve speed, unused items are removed from the transaction
data before creating the prefix tree (this behavior can be changed using the
argument <code>reduce</code>). This might be slower for large transaction
data sets. However, this is highly recommended as the items are also
reordered to reduce the counting time.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"apriori"</code> <strong>method (always needs transactions):</strong>
All association rules are mined from the transactions data set using <code>apriori()</code>
with the
smallest support found in the itemsets. In a second step, all rules which cannot
be generated from one of the itemsets are removed. This procedure is very slow,
especially for itemsets with many elements or very low support.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class rules.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("Adult")

## find all closed frequent itemsets
closed_is &lt;- apriori(Adult, target = "closed frequent itemsets", support = 0.4)
closed_is

## use rule induction to produce all closed association rules
closed_rules &lt;- ruleInduction(closed_is, transactions = Adult, verbose = TRUE)

## inspect the resulting closed rules
summary(closed_rules)
inspect(head(closed_rules, by = "lift"))

## get rules from frequent itemsets. Here, transactions does not need to be
## specified for rule induction.
frequent_is  &lt;- eclat(Adult, support = 0.4)
assoc_rules &lt;- ruleInduction(frequent_is)
assoc_rules
inspect(head(assoc_rules))

## for itemsets that are not a complete set of frequent itemsets,
## transactions need to be specified.
some_is &lt;- sample(frequent_is, 10)
some_rules &lt;- ruleInduction(some_is, transactions = Adult)
some_rules
