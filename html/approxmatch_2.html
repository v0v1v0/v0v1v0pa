<h2>
Approximately Optimal Fine Balance Matching with Multiple Groups.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools for constructing a matched design with multiple comparison groups.
Further specifications of refined covariate balance restriction and exact match on 
covariate can be imposed. Matches are approximately optimal in  the sense that the 
cost of the solution is at most twice the optimal cost, Crama and Spieksma (1992)

approxmatch-package     Approximately Optimal Fine Balance Matching
                        with Multiple Groups.
covbalance              Check covariate balance of a design.
kwaymatching            Create approximately optimal matched strata of
                        multiple, at least two, groups.
multigrp_dist_struc     Construct the distance structure for the
                        multiple groups.
nrbalancematch          The is the background function to perform
                        matching using network optimization.

<p>An R package for creating matched strata with multiple treatments. Default 
design for a stratum structure is one unit from each treatment, but, other 
designs can be specified.  User can also fine match/ near fine match on 
one or more categorical covariates, e.g. sex and age group.
</p>
<p>The main functions of the package are <code>kwaymatching</code> and <code>tripletmatch</code>.
These functions take as input the distance structure of multiple groups and the grouping
information to create an approximately optimal multigroup design minimizing the 
total distance. A distance structure can be calculated as per requirement by 
the <code>multigrp_dist_struc</code> function. 
</p>
<p>The algorithm used to create matched design is an approximation algorithm developed
by Karmakar, Small and Rosenbaum (2019).  The design built is guaranteed to be 
close to the optimal matched design of the specified structure.
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to perform matching, <code>kwaymatching</code> requires the 
user to load the optmatch (&gt;= 0.9-1) package separately. A manual loading is 
required due to software license issues. If the package is not loaded, the 
<code>kwaymatching</code> command will fail with an error saying the optmatch package 
is not present. Reference to optmatch is given below.
