<h2>Construction of Consensus Distance Matrix With SDM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the SDM method of Criscuolo et al. (2006) for
a set of n distance matrices.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SDM(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>2n elements (with n &gt; 1), the first n elements are the
distance matrices: these can be (symmetric) matrices, objects of
class <code>"dist"</code>, or a mix of both. The next n elements are the
sequence length from which the matrices have been estimated (can be
seen as a degree of confidence in matrices).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Reconstructs a consensus distance matrix from a set of input distance
matrices on overlapping sets of taxa. Potentially missing values in
the supermatrix are represented by <code>NA</code>. An error is returned if
the input distance matrices can not resolve to a consensus matrix.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a 2-element list containing a distance matrix labelled by the union of
the set of taxa of the input distance matrices, and a variance matrix
associated to the returned distance matrix.
</p>
