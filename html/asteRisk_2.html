<h2>Calculate Modified Julian Date for a given date and time
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Julian Date (JD) of a given date and time is the number of days since noon of
Monday 1st of January 4713 BC, including a fractional part. Modified Julian Date
(MJD) are instead the number of days since 00:00 of November 17th, 1858. The 
difference JD and MJD for a given instant is always 2400000.5, which is the JD
of the reference time for MJD.
</p>
<p>This function calculates the MJD of a date and time, provided as a date-time
character string in UTC time. The output refers by default to the MJD in UTC,
but different time systems can be chosen: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time),
UT1 (Universal Time), TT (Terrestrial Time) and TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dateTimeToMJD(dateTime, timeSystem="UTC")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dateTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>Date-time string with the date and time in UTC corresponding
to the provided geodetic coordinates.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timeSystem</code></td>
<td>
<p>Time system into which the MJD should be calculated. Should
be one from "UTC" (Coordinated Universal Time; default), "UT1" (Universal Time), 
"TT" (Terrestrial Time) and "TDB" (Barycentric Dynamical Time).
</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The MJD for the specified date and time in the chosen time system.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">if(requireNamespace("asteRiskData", quietly = TRUE)) {
# Let's calculate the MJD of the 12th of June, 2000 at 10:00:00 UTC time, in UTC

MJD_UTC &lt;- dateTimeToMJD("2000-06-12 10:00:00", timeSystem = "UTC")

# Let's now calculate the MJD for the same instant in TDB:

MJD_TDB &lt;- dateTimeToMJD("2000-06-12 10:00:00", timeSystem = "TDB")

# We can now calculate the difference in seconds, which matches the difference 
# between UTC and TDB for that day:

(MJD_UTC - MJD_TDB) * 86400
}
