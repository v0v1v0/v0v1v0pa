<h2>Example data for Faith's phylogenetic diversity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This example was used to illustrate phylogenetic diversity in Faith and
Richards (2012).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">faith_tree
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>faith_tree</code> is a phylogenetic tree with five tips, labeled
a-e. It was created with the <code>ape</code> library.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the paper, they give the total branch length as 41, but they
don't assign a length to the branch leading to species "b" and "c". Looking
at the figure, we estimated that the length should be 4. For that reason,
the total branch length of <code>faith_tree</code> is 45, rather than 41.
