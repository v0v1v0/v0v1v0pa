<h2>Sloan Digital Sky Survey point source photometry: Training sample</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Together with SDSS_ptsrc_teset, these two datasets are designed to exercise methods of supervised classification in low dimensions. The datasets are extracted from the very large (~300 million) Sloan Digital Sky Survey in five photometric bands (ugriz). See York et al. (2000) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey</a> for background on the survey.  The SDSS_test sample has four color indices (u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z) for 12884 unclassified point sources from the 5th Data Release.  The SDSS_train sample has the four color indices together with known classes for 9000 well-characterized Sloan point sources:  2000 quasars (Class 1), 5000 main sequence and giant stars (Class 2), and 2000 white dwarfs (Class 3).  The references, extraction and pre-processing necessary to obtain these samples are described in Appendix C.9 of Feigelson &amp; Babu (2012).  Application of statistican and machine learning classification methods area given in Chapter 9.
