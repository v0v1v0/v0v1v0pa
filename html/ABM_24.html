<h2>Create a logger of the StateLogger class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When state changes occur, it is passed to each logger, which then
change its value. At the specified time points in a run, the
values of the logger are reported and recorded in a data.frame object,
where the columns represent variables, and rows represent the
observation at each time point given to each run. Each logger has a
name, which becomes the the column name in the data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the logger. A length-1 character vector</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>agent</code></td>
<td>
<p>the agent whose state will be logged. An external pointer</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>state.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>the state name of the state of the agent to be logged.
A character vector of length 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If a state changed happened to any agent, the specified state
of the agent given by the "agent" argument will be logged. If
<code>state.name==NULL</code> then the state of the agent who just changed is
logged.
</p>
<p>The agent must be an external pointer. To use an R6 object, we need
to use its $get method to get the external pointer.
</p>
<p>The state to be logged must have a numeric value.
