<h2>Alice's gene data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset relating to the following fictitious experiment:
Participants who had facial burns were recruited. One-week pre-test, a gene C-10XFMG (the so-called chameleon gene)
was introduced into all participants.Two days prior to test, a genetic toggle switch was introduced into half of the participants.
Half of the participants were asked to look at a photograph of themselves from before their injury and to imagine the cells in their faces
changing to become like the photo. The remainder acted as a control and were asked to look at a picture of a same-sex stranger and to try
to change their face to become the person in the picture. All participants looked at the picture for 6 sessions of 20 minutes each.
At the end of the sessions their faces were scanned into a computer and compared to the face in the photograph.
Facial recognition software produced a precise resemblance measure as a percentage (100
in the photograph, 0
The data are taken from Chapter 17 of Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage.
