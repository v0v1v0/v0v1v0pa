<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>amExample1</code> High quality data set<br><code>amExample2</code> Good quality data set<br><code>amExample3</code> Marginal quality data set<br><code>amExample4</code> Low quality data set<br><code>amExample5</code> Wildlife data set<br></p>
<p>Data sets 1 to 4 are simulated. Because the data are simulated, the individual from which the
samples are derived is known. This is given in the column <code>knownIndividual</code>, and permits an
assessment of how effective the software has been.
</p>
<p>Data set 5 is a real dataset from a wildlife population that has been non-invasively
sampled. The meta-data has been fabricated. It represents the output from allele calling software.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">	data(amExample1)
	data(amExample2)
	data(amExample3)
	data(amExample4)
	data(amExample5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frames with differing numbers of samples in rows, and alleles in columns. Missing data is
represented as "-99".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note how in <code>amExample5</code> a single marker "Gender" has been combined with diploid loci.<br>
Also note how in all data sets in diploid loci the lower length allele always comes first.<br>
This pattern is typical in allele calling software.
