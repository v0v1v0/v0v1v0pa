<h2>Toluca Company data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Toluca Company data in Applied Linear
Statistical Models, 5th edition, p. 19. From the book:
</p>
<p>The Toluca Company manufactures refrigeration equipment
as well as many replacement parts. In the past, one of
the replacement parts has been produced periodically in
lots of varying sizes. When a cost improvement program
was undertaken, company officials wished to determine
the optimum lot size for producing this part. The
production of this part involves setting up the
production process (which must be done no matter what
is the lot size) and machining and assembly operations.
One key input for the model to ascertain the optimum
lot size was the relationship between lot size  and
labor hours  required to produce the lot. To determine
this relationship, data on lot size (<code>lot_size</code>)
and work hours (<code>work_hours</code>) for 25 recent
production runs were utilized.
