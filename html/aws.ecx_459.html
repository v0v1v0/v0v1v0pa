</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list object or a character vector
</p>


<h3>cluster</h3>

<p>The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of the cluster on which to run your service. If you do not specify a
cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
</p>


<h3>serviceName</h3>

<p>The name of
your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and
hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but
you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a
Region or across multiple Regions.
</p>


<h3>taskDefinition</h3>

<p>The <code>family</code> and <code>revision</code> (<code>family:revision</code>) or full ARN of the task
definition to run in your service. If a <code>revision</code> is not specified, the
latest <code>ACTIVE</code> revision is used.
</p>
<p>A task definition must be specified if the service is using either the
<code>ECS</code> or <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controllers.
</p>


<h3>loadBalancers</h3>

<p>A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your
service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service Load Balancing</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>If the service is using the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment controller
and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer,
you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service.
The service-linked role is required for services that make use of
multiple target groups. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>If the service is using the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, the
service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or
Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group,
you specify two target groups (referred to as a <code>targetGroupPair</code>).
During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your
service has the status <code>PRIMARY</code> and associates one target group with
it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task
set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required
listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you
perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production
traffic to it.
</p>
<p>After you create a service using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the
load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container
port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using
the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, these values can be changed
when updating the service.
</p>
<p>For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object
must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as
it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access
from the load balancer. The load balancer name parameter must be
omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container
instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a
target in the target group specified here.
</p>
<p>For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer
name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and
the container port to access from the load balancer. The target group
ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed
on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the
load balancer specified here.
</p>
<p>Services with tasks that use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode (for example,
those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not
supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services,
you must choose <code>ip</code> as the target type, not <code>instance</code>, because tasks
that use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode are associated with an elastic
network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
</p>


<h3>serviceRegistries</h3>

<p>The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this
service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service Discovery</a>.
</p>
<p>Service discovery is supported for Fargate tasks if you are using
platform version v1.1.0 or later. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html">AWS Fargate Platform Versions</a>.
</p>


<h3>desiredCount</h3>

<p>The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place
and keep running on your cluster.
</p>
<p>This is required if <code>schedulingStrategy</code> is <code>REPLICA</code> or is not
specified. If <code>schedulingStrategy</code> is <code>DAEMON</code> then this is not
required.
</p>


<h3>clientToken</h3>

<p>Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide
to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 32 ASCII characters are
allowed.
</p>


<h3>launchType</h3>

<p>The launch type on which to run your service. For more information, see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html">Amazon ECS Launch Types</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>If a <code>launchType</code> is specified, the <code>capacityProviderStrategy</code> parameter
must be omitted.
</p>


<h3>capacityProviderStrategy</h3>

<p>The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.
</p>
<p>A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers
along with the <code>base</code> and <code>weight</code> to assign to them. A capacity
provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity
provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers
with an <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>UPDATING</code> status can be used.
</p>
<p>If a <code>capacityProviderStrategy</code> is specified, the <code>launchType</code> parameter
must be omitted. If no <code>capacityProviderStrategy</code> or <code>launchType</code> is
specified, the <code>defaultCapacityProviderStrategy</code> for the cluster is
used.
</p>
<p>If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be
created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.
</p>
<p>To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the <code>FARGATE</code> or
<code>FARGATE_SPOT</code> capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers
are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a
cluster to be used.
</p>
<p>The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list
of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is
created.
</p>


<h3>platformVersion</h3>

<p>The platform version that your tasks in the service
are running on. A platform version is specified only for tasks using the
Fargate launch type. If one isn\'t specified, the <code>LATEST</code> platform
version is used by default. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html">AWS Fargate Platform Versions</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
Guide</em>.
</p>


<h3>role</h3>

<p>The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows
Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This
parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your
service and your task definition does not use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode.
If you specify the <code>role</code> parameter, you must also specify a load
balancer object with the <code>loadBalancers</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role,
that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role
here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses
the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode or if the service is configured to use service
discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or
Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you should not specify a
role here. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>If your specified role has a path other than <code>/</code>, then you must either
specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name
with the path. For example, if a role with the name <code>bar</code> has a path of
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠/foo/⁠</code> then you would specify <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠/foo/bar⁠</code> as the role name. For more
information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names">Friendly Names and Paths</a>
in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
</p>


<h3>deploymentConfiguration</h3>

<p>Optional deployment parameters that control how
many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and
starting tasks.
</p>


<h3>placementConstraints</h3>

<p>An array of placement constraint
objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of
10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task
definition and those specified at runtime).
</p>


<h3>placementStrategy</h3>

<p>The
placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can
specify a maximum of five strategy rules per
service.
</p>


<h3>networkConfiguration</h3>

<p>The network configuration for the service.
This parameter is required for task definitions that use the <code>awsvpc</code>
network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is
not supported for other network modes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html">Task Networking</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
Guide</em>.
</p>


<h3>healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds</h3>

<p>The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler
should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks
after a task has first started. This is only used when your service is
configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer
defined and you don\'t specify a health check grace period value, the
default value of <code>0</code> is used.
</p>
<p>If your service\'s tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic
Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace
period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS
service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can
prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and
stopping them before they have time to come up.
</p>


<h3>schedulingStrategy</h3>

<p>The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information,
see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Services</a>.
</p>
<p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>REPLICA</code>-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service is
using the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>DAEMON</code>-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When
you\'re using this strategy, you don\'t need to specify a desired
number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto
Scaling policies.
</p>
<p>Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or
<code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types don\'t support the <code>DAEMON</code>
scheduling strategy.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>deploymentController</h3>

<p>The deployment controller to use for the
service.
</p>


<h3>tags</h3>

<p>The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as
well.
</p>
<p>The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
characters: + - = . _ : / @.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Do not use <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠aws:⁠</code>, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠AWS:⁠</code>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>enableECSManagedTags</h3>

<p>Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags
for the tasks within the service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.html">Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
Guide</em>.
</p>


<h3>propagateTags</h3>

<p>Specifies whether to propagate the tags from
the task definition or the service to the tasks in the service. If no
value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be
propagated to the tasks within the service during service creation. To
add tags to a task after service creation, use the TagResource API
action.
</p>
