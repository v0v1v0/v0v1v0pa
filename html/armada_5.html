<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To obtain the dendrogram of the covariates contained in the data.frame X, and a proposition for the number of clusters of covariates in X.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clustering(X, plot = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>the matrix (or data.frame) of covariates, dimension n*p (n is the sample size, p the number of covariates).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>if plot = TRUE" (default value): it gives the dendrogram and the plot of the height versus the number of clusters, for the 30 first clusters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a 2-list composed by: "tree" (the dendrogram of X), and "nclust" which is a proposition of the number of clusters. The proposed number of clusters is calculated as following: in the graph of the decreasing height versus the number of clusters, we define variation_height = (height[1:29]-height[2:30])/height[2:30], and our proposition is nclust=min(which(variation_height&lt;0.05)). It is preferable that the user chooses its own number of clusters. Warning: nclust must be not too high. Indeed, if nclust is too high, the clusters contain a small number of covariates, and it is then possible that all the covariates of one or several cluster(s) are included in H0. In that case, the FAMT procedure will have a dysfunction.
