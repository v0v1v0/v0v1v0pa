<h2>Example Data of Continuous Observations and Ensemble Forecasts</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Continuous observations (obsv) and 9-member ensemble forecasts (fcst) of the
Nino-3.4 index for January 1961-2000. The forecast data stem from model runs
initialized using data for the preceding August 1960-1999.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is:<br> List of 3<br> \$ years: int [1:40] 1961 1962 1963
1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 ...<br> \$ obsv : num [1:40] 26.2 26.2
25.9 27.4 25.8 ...<br> \$ fcst : num [1:40, 1:9] 26.5 25.9 27.0 27.5 25.8 ...</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The forecast data are from the coupled ocean-atmosphere model of the Centre
National de Recherches Meteorologiques (CNRM) of Meteo France and were
generated as part of the "Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble
System for Seasonal to Interannual Prediction (DEMETER)" project (Palmer et
al. 2004). Note that also the examples presented in the 2AFC paper by Mason
and Weigel (2009) are based on these data.
