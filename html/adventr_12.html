<h2>Zombie recovery data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset not from Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage, but continuing the theme of the story. At the end of the book
it is revealed that Alice used her C-gene therapy to restore the code 1318 workers to a human state. This dataset relates to her third attempt. It contains data from 400 code 1318 workers.
Workers were randomly assigned to two arms of a trial (C-gene therapy and C-gene therapy with a toggle switch). They were also given one of five different doses of C-gene: 0 (no dose) or 1, 2, 3, or 4 doses.
The outcome was whether (or not) the worker had fully recovered after the treatment.
