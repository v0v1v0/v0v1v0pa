"none", all new recruits are added to the breeding population; individuals 
are randomly removed from that pool to truncate the population at K (so 
new recruits may randomly replace established breeders).  When adults will 
likely survive and prevent new individuals from recruiting, e.g. with 
territorial species, set this at one of the other values as appropriate 
for your species.  When pairing off widowed or divorced individuals, those 
of the retained sex(es) that bred previously will be guaranteed a new mate 
(if available); non-retained adults will compete with new recruits to mate 
with available adults.  If the population is at K, new recruits will only 
fill vacancies left by adults that died (they will not replace any

survival (as in Morris &amp; Doak 2002, Quantitative Conservation Biology):  
S(E(t)) = S(0)/(1 + beta * E(t)), where S(E(t)) is survival rate at 
population density E in year t, S(0) is survival when density is near 0, 
beta is the decline in survival as density increases, and E(t) is 
population density at time t.  "Density" is defined in our model as the 
proportion of K that has been filled, as there is no spatial information 
in the model.  The model solves for beta according to the user-specified 
values for nonbrsurv (S(0)) and nonbrsurvK (S at carrying capacity, where 
E = 1), then uses beta and S(0) to calculate density-dependent survival 
probability in each year </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The user indicates the number of individuals released to establish the 
population (bottleneck size), along with their age class (adult or 
juvenile), sex ratio, and post-release survival rate. These individuals can 
be released all at once or gradually over a period of years. Released 
individuals are assumed to be unrelated and are randomly assigned genotypes 
(zero, one, or two copies of a hypothetical neutral allele) according to a 
user-specified frequency of the allele in the source population. The 
simulated population can be held at the initial size to simulate a 
prolonged bottleneck (while reproduction occurs) or the user can specify a 
post-release lag with no reproduction. Otherwise, released individuals 
mature and recruit according to user-specified parameters. Species with 
delayed sexual maturity are modeled by preventing subadults from breeding 
until a user-specified age. Adults are randomly sorted into monogamous or 
polygynous breeding pairs, which re-form for multiple matings within one 
season (in polygynandry systems), remain together seasonally (in monogamous 
or polygynous systems), or remain together lifelong (in monogamous systems) 
depending on user-specified settings. Reproduction occurs each year based 
on individual or population means (depending on settings for individual 
variation in reproductive output) for the number of offspring produced per 
pair per year, which can change with age of the parents. Sex is randomly 
assigned to each offspring according to the user-specified sex ratio for 
juveniles and offspring inherit alleles from their parents via Mendelian 
inheritance. When the simulated population reaches the specified carrying 
capacity, population growth ceases by either preventing recruitment of 
offspring or removing randomly selected individuals (as indicated by the 
user).  When individuals are removed at random, the user can choose to give 
priority to remain in the population to established breeders and/or 
immigrants (if any). Annual survival of individuals is determined by 
user-specified probabilities for each age class, with optional sex-specific 
survival rates for adults. The user can choose to incorporate density 
dependence into juvenile and subadult/nonbreeder survival probabilities 
and/or to specify senescence effects in survival of adults beyond a certain 
age.
</p>
<p>The model simulates immigration at regular user-specified intervals by 
adding more individuals from the original source population. Immigrants can 
be prioritized over locally produced individuals to recruit into breeding 
vacancies. This scenario may be realistic when most locally produced 
juveniles would emigrate, or when locally produced juveniles would be 
removed by managers (e.g. to contribute to other populations or to make 
room for immigrants). Emigration can be simulated in this model by reducing 
the survival value for the appropriate age class, assuming emigrants and 
their descendants do not return to the modeled population. 
</p>
<p>Frequency of the allele of interest in the simulated population is recorded 
after each year of the simulation. The proportion of iterations in which 
the allele is retained to the end of the specified time period is 
interpreted as the probability of retaining the allele in the population 
over that period. The model outputs a census of the simulated 
population (adults, subadults/nonbreeders, pairs, founders, and immigrants) 
each year, and a list of information for each individual in the simulated 
population.  The census information can be averaged across replicates with 
<code>aRetain.summary</code>.  An individual summary function (<code>indiv.summary</code>)
can output pertinent information (e.g. proportion bred, average number that 
bred per generation) about individuals of each origin (founder, local, or 
immigrant) in the population.  A pedigree summary function 
(<code>pedigree.summary</code>) can be used to describe accumulation of inbreeding 
in the population by calling R package <b>pedigree</b>.  
</p>
<p>See the AlleleRetain Model Guide (available as a PDF file with this 
installation, or from the model's website at 
https://sites.google.com/site/alleleretain/) for more details and an example.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>aRetain</code> returns a list of sub-lists, with one sub-list for each replicate 
which contains two matrices: one that summarizes the population information for 
that replicate (one row for each year; columns = number of adults, number of 
breeding females, number of breeding males, number of copies of the rare allele, 
number of pairs, number of nonbreeders, number of founders remaining, number of 
migrants alive, mean age of breeding pairs), and one that gives pertinent 
information for all individuals in that replicate (one row for each individual; 
columns = ID, dam, sire, origin [1=starter, 2=supplemental, 3=local, 
4=immigrant], birth year, number of years alive in the population, number of 
years bred, year added to population).   The latter matrix includes all 
individuals if <code>trackall = TRUE</code>, or only those alive at the end of the 
simulation if <code>trackall = FALSE</code>.  Run <code>aRetain.summary</code>, 
<code>indiv.summary</code>, and <code>pedigree.summary</code> to generate useful output from 
this information (averaged across replicates).
