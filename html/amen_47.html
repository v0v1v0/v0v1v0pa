<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several dyadic variables measured on 18 members of a monastery.

<h3>Format</h3>

Each monk was asked to rank up to three other monks on a variety of positive 
and negative relations. A rank of three indicates the "highest" ranking for 
a particular relational variable. The relations <code>like_m2</code> and <code>like_m1</code>
are evaluations of likeing at one and two timepoints previous to when the 
other relations were measured.
