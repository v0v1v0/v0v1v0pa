<h2>Demo Data: Coordinates of a single source, centre, location</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a simple two-element vector containing x,y coordinates for a source or central location associated with a spatial point pattern. In this example, the center location represents a point of importance in an individuals daily activity pattern. Surrounding point locations are places physically contacted by an individual during a particular time interval. Demonstration data mimics UTM coordinates such that the first element represents Easting (x), and the second, Northing (y).</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(centre)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is a two-element vector of numeric entries.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The coordinates of the center must have the same units and projection as the remaining point observations.</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>This demonstration data has been manufactured for illustrative purposes only.</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  data(centre)
  str(centre)
  plot(centre)
  
## plot_centres by default takes as input the result produced from mean_centre,
## median centre, CF, CF2PTS, and CMD, read from the current workspace.
</code></pre>
