<h2>Create the segment container</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function combines rules into a container.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">seg_con(context = "hits", conjunction = "and", rules = NULL, exclude = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>context</code></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the level that the segment logic should operate on.
Valid values are visitors, visits, and hits. See Details</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conjunction</code></td>
<td>
<p>This defines the relationship of the rules.  <code>And</code> (default)
and <code>or</code> are the two options.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rules</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of rules and/or containers. Must be wrapped in a list()
function. Adding a container list item will nest it within a container.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exclude</code></td>
<td>
<p>Exclude the entire container</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Context</strong>
</p>
<p>The rules in a segment have a context that specify the level of operation.
The context can be "visitors", "visits" or "hits."
As an example, let's build a segment rule where revenue is greater than 0
(meaning a purchase took place) and change the context to see how things change.
If the context is set to "visitors", the segment includes all hits from visitors
that have a purchase of some kind during a visit. This is useful in analyzing
customer behavior in visits leading up to a purchase and possibly behavior after a purchase.
If the context is set to "visits", the segment includes all hits from visits where
a purchase occurred. This is useful for seeing the behavior of a visitor in
immediate page views leading up to the purchase.
If the context is set to "hit", the segment only includes hits where a purchase
occurred, and no other hits. This is useful in seeing which products were most popular.
In the above example, the context for the container listed is hits. This means
that the container only evaluates data at the hit level,
(in contrast to visit or visitor level). The rules in the container are also at the hit level.
