<h2>
Incomplete distances and edge weights of unrooted topology
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements a method for checking whether an incomplete
set of distances satisfy certain conditions that might make it
uniquely determine the edge weights of a given topology, T. It prints
information about whether the graph with vertex set the set of leaves,
denoted by X, and edge set the set of non-missing distance pairs,
denoted by L, is connected or strongly non-bipartite. It then also
checks whether L is a triplet cover for T.
</p>

<p>This implements a method for checking whether an incomplete set of
distances satisfies certain conditions that might make it uniquely
determine the edge weights of a given topology, T. It prints
information about whether the graph, G, with vertex set the set of
leaves, denoted by X, and edge set the set of non-missing distance
pairs, denoted by L, is connected or strongly non-bipartite. It also
checks whether L is a triplet cover for T. If G is not connected, then
T does not need to be the only topology satisfying the input
incomplete distances. If G is not strongly non-bipartite then the
edge-weights of the edges of T are not the unique ones for which the
input distance is satisfied. If L is a triplet cover, then the input
distance matrix uniquely determines the edge weights of T. See Dress
et al. (2012) for details.
