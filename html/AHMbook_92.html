Data for observations of Middle Spotted Woodpecker in Switzerland
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set is based on checklists which volunteers submit from their bird-watching trips and which were then summarized by day and site (1 km2 quadrat) such that we have the number of surveys (= checklists) per quadrat and day, and the number among these on which a Middle-Spotted Woodpecker was recorded, during 162 days (Julian days 51–212, corresponding to 20 February–31 July). There are data from a total of 144,517 recorded surveys on 116,204 day/quadrat combinations during 26 years from 1545 1 km2 quadrats in which the species was ever recorded in Switzerland since 1985.
