<h2>
Makes a "connection" relationships graph including the "similarity" relationships.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a <code>frag.object</code> in argument and returns an undirected graph representing the relationships between archaeological fragments. "Connection" and "similiarity" relationships are combined. A "connection" relationship refers to a physical connection between two fragments that were part of the same object. A "similarity" relationship between fragments is defined if there is an acceptable likelihood that those fragments were part of the same object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">    make_crsr_graph(object)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>frag.object</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A complementary function to the <code>make_cr_graph</code> function. This function handles both the "connection" and "similarity" relationships.  This can be useful, given that "similarity" relations are more frequently documented in archaeological datasets than the "connection" relationships. 
</p>
<p>The function returns an undirected graph of "<code>igraph</code>" class, using the "fragments" data frame of the frag.object to set the vertices attributes. 
</p>
<p>Both "connection" and "similarity" relationships are included in the resulting graph. The edge attribute "type_relation" is set with a character "cr" value for "connection" relationships and with "sr" for "similarity" relationships. 
Edge weights are not set by this function, and it is recommended to use the <code>frag.edges.weighting</code> function. A "frag_type" graph attribute is set with a "connection and similarity" value.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An undirected "igraph" class graph.</p>
