<h2>An interactive alternating renewal process simulator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An interactive tool that simulates single-case designs with
outcomes measured by systematic direct observation. The behavioral outcomes
are generated from the alternating renewal process model. Both event
behaviors and state behaviors are supported. Event behaviors are generated
from a renewal process with gamma-distributed inter-event times. State
behaviors are generated from an alternating poisson process, in which the
event durations and interim times are exponentially distributed. Currently,
multiple baseline and treatment reversal designs are supported.
