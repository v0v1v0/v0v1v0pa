<h2>The data used in Chapter 9, Table 1</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data used in Chapter 9, Table 1
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(chapter_9_table_1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with 6 rows and 3 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data in Table 9.1 are the numerical values for the data that is presented in Figure 9.1, which presents a comparison of errors in ANOVA and ANCOVA restricted models.
</p>
<p>The data represents a pre-post design, where a training program designed to assist people in losing weight is evaluated. An initial measure of weight is collected to use as a baseline measure (specifically as a covariate in the present analysis) and then participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups. At the end of the training program another measure of weight is obtained. The question of interest is: "did the participants who received the treatment lose more weight than those that were assigned to the wait-list control group?"
