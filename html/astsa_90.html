<h2>
Sleep State and Movement Data - Group 1
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sleep-state and number of movements of infants taken from a study on the effects of
prenatal exposure to alcohol. This is Group 1 where the mothers did not drink alcohol
during pregnancy.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>List of 12 (by subjects)
:'data.frame':	120 obs. of  3 variables:
.. min  : int [1:120] minute (1 to 120)
.. state: int [1:120] sleep state 1 to 6 with NA missing (see details)
.. mvmnt: int [1:120] number of movements
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Per minute sleep state, for approximately 120 minutes, is categorized into one of
six possible states, non-REM: NR1 [1] to NR4 [4], and REM [5], or AWAKE [6].
NA means no state is recorded for that minute (if there, it occurs at end of the session).
Group 1 (this group) is from mothers who abstained from drinking during
pregnancy. In addition, the number of movements per minute are listed.
