<h2>ards: A package for creating Analysis Results Datasets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An Analysis Results Dataset (ARDS) is commonly used in the pharma-biotech industry
to capture the results of an analysis in a tabular data structure.  The <strong>ards</strong>
package helps create the ARDS. <strong>ards</strong> functions can be called from inside 
a report program or a data preparation program.  The functions use a 
"bucketing" approach, whereby data can be added to the ARDS in multiple 
calls and from multiple intermediate data sets.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <strong>ards</strong> package allows you to easily create an ARDS dataset
in a standard clinical reporting or data preparation program.  The 
<strong>ards</strong> package contains only three functions, and each will
be used to create the ARDS dataset.  The functions will be called in the 
following order, and for the described purpose:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>init_ards</code>: Initialize an ARDS dataset
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>add_ards</code>: Add data to an ARDS dataset
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>get_ards</code>: Extract the completed ARDS
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the links above for more information about each function.
</p>
<p>The following figure describes the structure of the ARDS dataset.  This
structure is recommended by CDISC.
