<h2>Example data for univariate error-prone covariates in repeated measurements case</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset gives an example data for the illustration of usage of <code>augSIMEX</code> function. The data set is adapted from the outbred Carworth Farms White mice data (Parker et. al., 2016). The dataset contains main data and validation data. We are interested to study the association between the response genotype of rs223979909 and the locomotor response to methamphetamine injections, which is subject to mismeasurement. 
</p>
<p>Tibia_5 - Tibia_30: the repeated measurement of tibia length
Tibia_M: the error-prone measurement of tibia length
Batch_T: the precisely labeled batch effect
Batch_O: the observed batch effect
Weight:  the body weights of the mice
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(GeneRepeat)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of two data frames. Main data (rs38916331, Totdist5,  Totdist10, Totdist15, Totdist20, Totdist25, Totdist30, Weight, Batch_O) and validation data (Batch_T, Batch_O).</p>
