<h2>Zombie rehabilitation longitudinal data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset not from Field, A. P. (2016). An adventure in statistics: the reality enigma. London: Sage, but continuing the theme of the story. At the end of the book
it is revealed that Alice used her C-gene therapy to restore the code 1318 workers to a human state. This dataset relates to her second attempt. It contains data from
141 code 1318 workers measured at four timepoints (baseline and 1, 6, and 12 month follow-up). Workers were randomly assigned to two arms of the trial (wait list vs. C-gene therapy) and the outcome was
how much they resembled their pre-zombie state (as a percentage).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rehab_growth_dat
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble with 564 rows and 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Participant ID</p>
</dd>
<dt>intervention</dt>
<dd>
<p>character vector that codes which arm of the trial the participant was randomized to (wait list or gene therapy)</p>
</dd>
<dt>resemblance</dt>
<dd>
<p>How closely their face resembled their pre-zombified state (100% = the participants face is exactly like their original face, 0% the person bears no resemblance to their pre-zombified face)</p>
</dd>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>Character vector that expresses when resemblance was measured as "t0" (baseline), "t1" (1 month follow-up), "t6" (6-month follow up) and "t12" (12-month follow-up)</p>
</dd>
<dt>time_num</dt>
<dd>
