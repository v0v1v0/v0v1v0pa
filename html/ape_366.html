<h2>Read Tree File in Nexus Format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function reads one or several trees in a NEXUS file.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read.nexus(file, tree.names = NULL, force.multi = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>a file name specified by either a variable of mode character,
or a double-quoted string.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>if there are several trees to be read, a vector of
mode character giving names to the individual trees (by default,
this uses the labels in the NEXUS file if these are present).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force.multi</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value; if <code>TRUE</code>, an object of class
<code>"multiPhylo"</code> is always returned even if the file contains a
single tree (see details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The present implementation tries to follow as much as possible the
NEXUS standard (but see the restriction below on TRANSLATION
tables). Only the block “TREES” is read; the other data can be read
with other functions (e.g., <code>read.dna</code>,
<code>read.table</code>, ...).
</p>
<p>If a TRANSLATION table is present it is assumed that only the tip
labels are translated and they are all translated with integers
without gap. Consequently, if nodes have labels in the tree(s) they
are read as they are and not looked for in the translation table. The
logic behind this is that in the vast majority of cases, node labels
will be support values rather than proper taxa names. This is
consistent with <code>write.nexus</code> which translates only the
tip labels.
</p>
<p>Using <code>force.multi = TRUE</code> when the file contains a single tree
makes possible to keep the tree name (as names of the list).
</p>
<p>‘read.nexus’ tries to represent correctly trees with a badly
represented root edge (i.e. with an extra pair of parentheses). For
instance, the tree "((A:1,B:1):10);" will be read like "(A:1,B:1):10;"
but a warning message will be issued in the former case as this is
apparently not a valid Newick format. If there are two root edges
(e.g., "(((A:1,B:1):10):10);"), then the tree is not read and an error
message is issued.

<p>an object of class <code>"phylo"</code> or <code>"multiPhylo"</code>.
