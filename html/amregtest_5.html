<h2>Example 4 Low quality data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is sample data copied from allelematch::amExampleData in version 5.2.1
of package allelematch. We use this data to test allelematch backwards compatibility.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with samples in rows, and alleles in columns. Missing data is represented as "-99".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For this example we have simulated a low quality data set where uncertainty created
by genotyping error and missing data, combined with a lack of information in the form
of allelic diversity across loci will result in a low confidence assessment of the unique
genotypes. At each locus a random 6% of heterozygotes lost their second allele to
simulate an allele dropout, and a random 20% of samples at each locus had alleles set
to missing.
