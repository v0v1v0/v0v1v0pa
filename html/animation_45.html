<h2>Demonstration of the Quincunx (Bean Machine/Galton Box)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulates the quincunx with “balls” (beans) falling through several layers
(denoted by triangles) and the distribution of the final locations at which
the balls hit is denoted by a histogram; <code>quincunx()</code> is shows single
layer, and <code>quincunx2()</code> is a two-stage version of the quincunx.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">quincunx(
  balls = 200,
  layers = 15,
  pch.layers = 2,
  pch.balls = 19,
  col.balls = sample(colors(), balls, TRUE),
  cex.balls = 2
)

quincunx2(
  balls = 200,
  layers = 15,
  pch.layers = 2,
  pch.balls = 19,
  col.balls = sample(colors(), balls, TRUE),
  cex.balls = 2
)
</code></pre>

</td>

recommended</p>
</td>

<p>point character, colors and
magnification of balls</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The bean machine, also known as the quincunx or Galton box, is a device
invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal
distribution.
</p>
<p>When a ball falls through a layer, it can either go to the right or left side
with the probability 0.5. At last the location of all the balls will show us
the bell-shaped distribution.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named vector: the frequency table for the locations of the balls.
Note the names of the vector are the locations: 1.5, 2.5, ..., layers -
0.5.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The maximum number of animation frames is controlled by
<code>ani.options('nmax')</code> as usual, but it is strongly recommended that
<code>ani.options(nmax = balls + layers -2)</code>, in which case all the balls
will just fall through all the layers and there will be no redundant
animation frames.
