<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package for pulling spatial data from an ArcGIS REST API
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><img src="../help/figures/logo.png" alt="logo" width="15%">

The role of the arcpullr package is simple...to pull spatial data from an
ArcGIS REST API. These APIs are housed by various different agencies,
organizations, entitites, etc., but allow a consistent format for storing and
retrieving spatial data
</p>


<h3><code>get_spatial_layer</code></h3>

<p>This function makes up the core of the package. It allows users to pull
spatial data given a URL of an ArcGIS REST API. There are many additional
query parameters that can (and probably should) be added; however, we've
simplified many of these out for you with the functions below.
</p>


<h3>
<code>get_layer_by_spatial</code> family of functions</h3>

<p>These functions allow you to pull layers using a spatial query. The abstract
syntax is wrapped into the functions, so all you have to do is pass these
functions an sf object of the spatial area, line, or point you want to query
by. These functions include get_layer_by_poly, get_layer_by_point,
get_layer_by_line, get_layer_by_multipoint, and get_layer_by_envelope. It
should be fairly obvious what type of spatial layer each function takes with
the exception of get_layer_by_envelope except that it isn't particularly
useful for a single point.
</p>


<h3><code>get_image_layer</code></h3>

<p>This is one of the core functions of the package. It retrieves image service
layers from an ArcGIS REST API designated by the URL
</p>


<h3><code>get_map_layer</code></h3>

<p>This is one of the core functions of the package. It retrieves map service
layers from an ArcGIS REST API designated by the URL
</p>


<h3>Helper functions</h3>

<p>There are a few utility functions to help you along the way. The first is
<code>plot_layer</code>, which is a useful way to plot the spatial layer
you've tried to pull just to make sure it works. If you want fancier maps
you'd be better served with ggplot2 or tmaps, though.
</p>
<p>Other helpers include the <code>sf_objects</code> functions, which allow
you to easily create sf points, lines, and polygons with a few coordinates.
</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a <code>sql_where</code> function to help aid in building
more complex SQL WHERE clauses used to query by the where argument in the
retrieval functions above.
