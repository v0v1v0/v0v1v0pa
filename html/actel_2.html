<h2>actel: Acoustic Telemetry Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>actel is designed for studies where animals tagged with acoustic tags are expected
to move through receiver arrays. actel combines the advantages of automatic sorting and checking
of animal movements with the possibility for user intervention on tags that deviate from expected
behaviour. The three analysis functions: <code>explore</code>, <code>migration</code>
and <code>residency</code>, allow the users to analyse their data in a systematic way,
making it easy to compare results from different studies.
</p>


<h3>Input structure</h3>

<p>To be able to work with actel, you must prepare your data in a specific
format. To learn more about this, you need to have a look at the package
vignettes, which can be found by running <code>browseVignettes('actel')</code>. If
this function returns "No vignettes found", you can alternatively find
the vignettes online: <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=actel">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=actel</a>
</p>


<h3>Example dataset</h3>

<p>If this is the first time you are using actel, you can try running it on an
example dataset using the <code>exampleWorkspace</code> function. This function
deploys a set of example files following the structure described in the package
vignettes. Namely:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> biometrics.csv
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> deployments.csv
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> spatial.csv
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> detections/ (a folder with .csv files)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the example dataset is created, <code>exampleWorkspace</code> also provides
you with example code to run an <code>explore</code> analysis.
</p>
<p>Note that you can also run the <code>migration</code> and <code>residency</code>
analyses on the example dataset, e.g.:
</p>
<p><code>results &lt;- migration(tz = 'Europe/Copenhagen', report = TRUE)</code>
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p><code>results &lt;- residency(tz = 'Europe/Copenhagen', report = TRUE)</code>
</p>
<p>Note: Running these lines with <code>report = TRUE</code> will open an analysis report on your web browser.
</p>


<h3>Main functions</h3>

<p>The actel package provides three main analyses:
<code>explore</code>, <code>migration</code> and <code>residency</code>
</p>


<h4>explore</h4>

<p><code>explore</code> allows you to quickly get a summary of your data. You
can use <code>explore</code> to get a general feel for the study results,
and check if the input files are behaving as expected. It is also a good
candidate if you just want to validate your detections for later use in other
analyses.
</p>



<h4>migration</h4>

<p>The <code>migration</code> analysis runs the same initial checks as
<code>explore</code>, but on top of it, it analyses the animal behaviour.
By selecting the arrays that lead to success, you can define whether or not
your animals survived the migration. Additional plots help you find out if some
animals/tags has been acting odd. Multiple options allow you to tweak the
analysis to fit your study perfectly.
</p>



<h4>residency</h4>

<p>The <code>residency</code> analysis runs the same initial checks as
<code>explore</code>, but, similarly to <code>migration</code>, explores
particular points of the animal behaviour. If you want to know where your animals
were in each day of the study, how many animals were in each section each day,
and other residency-focused variables, this is the analysis you are looking
for!
