<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When batch rendering Rmd files, it is inevitable that some files fail. These
files would have their knit.md and utf.md present, but they would not have a
corresponding html file generated.
</p>
<p>This function is called for its' side-effect, to remove those lonely md files.
</p>
<p>If this clean-up is not done, when we try to re-run the files (perhaps with
some of the errors fixed), these straggling md files will cause problems. 
The most crucial one is that the Rmd files will not be re-knitted, even 
though they have been changed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No return value.
