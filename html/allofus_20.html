<h2>Function to query allofus observation table for survey responses</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extracts survey responses in a tidy format that also includes
‘skip’ responses and collapses across all versions of the person health /
personal medical history surveys. Currently responses in the ‘ds_survey’
table omit skipped responses. Responses are returned as Yes" if the
respondent answered that the individual had the condition, No" if the
respondent answered that the individual did not have that condition (or
omitted it when selecting from related conditions), a skip response if the
question was skipped, and NA if the respondent did not answer the question.
Returns a data frame or SQL tbl with the initial cohort table along with a
column for each question included in questions and answers foreach
person_id in the cells. To find the desired survey questions, use the all
of us data dictionary, survey codebook, Athena, data browser, or the
modified codebook which can be found in the allofus R package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">aou_survey(
  cohort = NULL,
  questions,
  question_output = "concept_code",
  clean_answers = TRUE,
  collect = FALSE,
  ...,
  con = getOption("aou.default.con")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cohort</code></td>
<td>
<p>Reference to a remote table or local dataframe with a column
called "person_id"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>questions</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a vector of concept_ids or concept_codes for
questions to return results</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>question_output</code></td>
<td>
<p>how to name the columns. Options include as the text
of the concept code ("concept_code"), as concept ids preceded by "x_"
("concept_id"), or using a custom vector of column names matching the
vector of <code>questions</code>. Defaults to "concept_code".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clean_answers</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether to clean the answers to the survey questions.
Defaults to TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>collect</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to bring the resulting table into local memory
(<code>collect = TRUE</code>) as a dataframe or leave as a reference to a database
table (for continued analysis using, e.g., <code>dbplyr</code>). Defaults to <code>FALSE.</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional arguments passed to <code>collect()</code> when <code>collect = TRUE</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>con</code></td>
<td>
<p>connection to the allofus SQL database. Defaults to
getOption("aou.default.con"), which is created automatically with
<code>aou_connect()</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function will return a dataframe or SQL tbl with the initial
cohort table along with a column for each question included in <code>questions</code>
and answers for each person_id in the cells. The column names (questions)
can be returned as the concept_code or concept_id or by providing new
column names. For each question, a column with the suffix "_date" is
included with the date on which the question was answered. When questions
can have multiple answers ("checkbox"-style questions), answers are
returned as a comma-separated string.
</p>
<p>To find the desired survey questions, use the all of us data dictionary,
survey codebook, athena, data browser, or the allofus R package modified
codebook which can be found here:
https://roux-ohdsi.github.io/allofus/articles/searchable_codebook.html For
questions regarding an individual's health history or family health
history, the function requires the specific concept_id (or concept_code)
for individual in question, whether that is "self" or another relative.
Responses are returned as "Yes" if the respondent answered that the
individual had the condition, "No" if the respondent answered that the
individual did not have that condition (or omitted it when selecting from
related conditions), a skip response if the question was skipped, and NA if
the respondent did not answer the question.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe if <code>collect = TRUE</code>; a reference to a remote database
table if not.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">

con &lt;- aou_connect()
cohort &lt;- dplyr::tbl(con, "person") %&gt;%
  dplyr::filter(person_id &gt; 5000000) %&gt;%
  dplyr::select(person_id, year_of_birth, gender_concept_id)

aou_survey(
  cohort,
  questions = c(1585375, 1586135),
  question_output = "concept_code"
)
aou_survey(
  cohort,
  questions = c(1585811, 1585386),
  question_output = c("pregnancy", "insurance")
)
aou_survey(
  cohort,
  questions = c(1585375, 1586135, 1740719, 43529932),
  question_output = c("income", "birthplace", "grandpa_bowel_obstruction", "t2dm"),
  collect = FALSE
)

aou_survey(cohort,
  questions = 1384452,
  question_output = "osteoarthritis"
) %&gt;%
  dplyr::count(osteoarthritis)
