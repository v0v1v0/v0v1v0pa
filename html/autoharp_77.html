<h2>Reset search path of current R session</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to detach packages that have been added by a student 
script.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reset_path(old_path)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>old_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of package namespaces. This is usually 
the output of <code>search</code>, run before an R script or Rmd 
file is rendered, which could cause the search path to change.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When a student script is rendered using <code>render_one</code>, 
new packages might be added to the search path. These may conflict with the 
instructors' search path order, or with subsequent runs of 
<code>render_one</code> on students. Hence there is a need to reset the 
search path before this is done.
</p>
<p>This function does not unload namespaces. It only detaches them from the 
search path. For a difference between the two, please see Hadley's page.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>There is no object returned. This function is called for it's side-
effect of altering the search path.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">opath &lt;- search()
# Load a package
reset_path(opath)
</code></pre>
