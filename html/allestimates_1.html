<h2>Effect estimates from models with all possible combinations of variables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To assess treatment effects in clinical trials and risk factors in bio-medical
and epidemiological research, we use
<em>regression coefficients</em>, <em>odds ratios</em> or <em>hazard ratios</em> as
<em>effect estimates</em>. <code>allestimates</code> allows users to quickly obtain
effect estimates from models with all possible combinations of a list of variables
specified by users. <code>all_lm</code> for linear regression, <code>all_glm</code> for
logistic regression, <code>all_speedglm</code>
using <code>speedlm</code> as a faster alternative of <code>all_glm</code>, and
<code>all_cox</code> for Cox Proportional Hazards Models. Users can further
use those values in a returned list of results.
<code>all_plot</code> draws scatter plots with all effect
estimate values against p values, as <code>Stata confall</code> command
(Wang Z (2007) &lt;doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203&gt;).
Those plots divide estimates into four categories:

<ul>
<li>
<p>positive and significant: left-top quarter
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>negative and significant: left-bottom quarter
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>positive and non-significant: right-top quarter
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>negative and non-significant: right-bottom quarter
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>all_plot2</code> draws multiple plots. Each of those plots
indicates whether a specific variable is included or
not included in models.
Those effect estimates help users better understand
confounding effects, uncertainty of their estimates, as well as
inappropriately including variables in the models. This is a tool for
calculating and exploring effect estimates from all possible models.
Interpretation of the results should be in the context of other
analyses and biological knowledge.
