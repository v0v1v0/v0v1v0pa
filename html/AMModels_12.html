<h2>Search for a model in a model list using <code>grep</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Enables adaptive management by codifying knowledge in the form of models
generated from numerous analyses and datasets. AMModels facilitates this process 
by storing all models and datasets in a single object that can be seemlessly 
updated, tracking changes in knowledge through time. A shiny application called 
AM Model Manager enables the use of these functions via a GUI. To launch the 
Model Manager, use <code>modelMgr()</code>.
