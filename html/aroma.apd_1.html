<h2>Package aroma.apd</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>This package has been deprecated. Do not start building new
projects based on it.</em>
</p>
<p>DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects based on this package. (The (in-house) APD file format was initially developed to store Affymetrix probe-level data, e.g. normalized CEL intensities.  Chip types can be added to APD file and similar to methods in the affxparser package, this package provides methods to read APDs organized by units (probesets).  In addition, the probe elements can be arranged optimally such that the elements are guaranteed to be read in order when, for instance, data is read unit by unit.  This speeds up the read substantially.  This package is supporting the Aroma framework and should not be used elsewhere.)
</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>This package requires the packages <span class="pkg">R.huge</span> and <span class="pkg">affxparser</span>.
</p>


<h3>Installation and updates</h3>

<p>To install this package, see <a href="https://www.braju.com/R/">https://www.braju.com/R/</a>.
</p>


<h3>To get started</h3>

<p>To get started, see:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>readApd</code>(), <code>readApdUnits</code>(), <code>readApdRectangle</code>()
- Reads APD files.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>celToApd</code>() - creates an APD file from a CEL file.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cdfToApdMap</code>() - creates an APD read map from a CDF file.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>findApdMap</code>() - finds an APD read map.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>createApd</code>(), <code>writeApd</code>() - creates APD files.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>updateApd</code>(), <code>updateApdUnits</code>() - updates APD files.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Search paths</h3>

<p>Typically you do not have to specify the pathname of the CDF file
when reading APD files or similar.  Instead, the chip type is
obtained from the APD header and the corresponding APD file is
search for in several predefined locations.  For details how to
specify the search path, see <code>findCdf</code>.
</p>
<p>Some APD files uses a corresponding read map in order to read data
faster.  The <code>findApdMap</code>() method is used to find the
corresponding APD map file containing the map vector.  How to
specify search paths for map files, see that method.
