<h2>Combines events file data with observational data across multiple events files
to produce and save charts</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reads in a csv file containing a list of events file locations and
overlay file locations, generating and saving spiral and linear charts for
each events file aligning the events file data with the corresponding overlay
data.
Where the overlay data is non-continuous data (such as sleeps diaries) the
csv file should have the columns start_time (dd-mm-YYYY HH:MM),
end_time (dd-mm-YYYY HH:MM) and category (text).
Where the overlay data is continuous data (such as continuous glucose monitoring)
the csv file should have the columns start_time (dd-mm-YYYY HH:MM) and
category (text).  In this case the end time coincides with the start time of
the subsequent observation.
The charts are saved as png images with two images generated for each events
file / overlay file pair (one spiral chart and one linear chart). <br><strong>Note</strong>: Spiral plots are generated using ggplot2 and coord_polar() and can take
45 - 60 seconds to generate each spiral plot.
