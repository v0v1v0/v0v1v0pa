<h2>Methods for Calculating marginal and Variable Costs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For Auction2ndCap, calcMC calculates (constant) marginal cost for each
product. For those classes that do not require prices, returns a
length-k vector of NAs when prices are not supplied.
</p>
<p>For Bertrand, calcMC computes either pre- or post-merger marginal costs. Marginal costs
are assumed to be constant. Post-merger marginal costs are equal to
pre-merger marginal costs multiplied by 1+‘mcDelta’, a length-k
vector of marginal cost changes. ‘mcDelta’ will typically be between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>For Auction2ndLogit, calcMC computes constant marginal costs impied by the model.
</p>
<p>For Cournot, calcMC calculates marginal cost for each product.
</p>
<p>calcdMC computes the derivative of either pre- or post-merger marginal costs. The derivative of Marginal costs
is assumed to be constant. Post-merger marginal costs are equal to
pre-merger marginal costs multiplied by 1+‘mcDelta’, a length-k
vector of marginal cost changes. ‘mcDelta’ will typically be between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>calcVC computes either pre- or post-merger variable costs. Variable costs
are assumed to be quadratic by default. Post-merger variable costs are equal to
pre-merger variable costs multiplied by 1+‘mcDelta’, a length-k
vector of marginal cost changes. ‘mcDelta’ will typically be between 0
and 1.

calcMC(object, preMerger = TRUE)

## S4 method for signature 'Auction2ndCap'
calcMC(object, t, preMerger = TRUE, exAnte = TRUE)

## S4 method for signature 'Cournot'
calcMC(object, preMerger = TRUE)

## S4 method for signature 'Auction2ndLogit'
calcMC(object, preMerger = TRUE, exAnte = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'Stackelberg'
calcdMC(object, preMerger = TRUE)

## S4 method for signature 'Cournot'
calcVC(object, preMerger = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of the respective class (see description for the classes)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preMerger</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the pre-merger ownership structure is used. If FALSE, the post-merger ownership structure is used.
Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>The capacity profile of each supplier. Default is ‘preMerger’ capacities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exAnte</code></td>
<td>
<p>If ‘exAnte’ equals TRUE then the
<em>ex ante</em> expected result for each firm is produced, while FALSE produces the
expected result conditional on each firm winning the auction. Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
