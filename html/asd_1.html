<h2>Simulation Tools for Adaptive Seamless Design (ASD)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to run simulations for trial designs that either (i) test a number of experimental treatments against a single control treatment group in a seamless adaptive trial or (ii) test an experimental treatment against a single control treatment group in a seamless adaptive trial with co-primary analyses in a pre-defined subgroup and the full population.<br>
In setting (i) test treatments are compared to the control treatment using Dunnett's many-to-one testing procedure, with an interim analysis undertaken using an early outcome measure. A decision is made on which of the treatments to take forward using a pre-defined selection rule. Data are simulated for the final outcome measure that is correlated with the early outcome measure. Data from the interim and final analyses for the final outcome measure are combined together using either the inverse normal or Fisher combination test and hypotheses are either rejected or accepted after controlling the familywise error rate at the selected level.<br>
In setting (ii) an interim analysis is undertaken using an early outcome measure and a decision is made on whether to continue with both full and subpopulations, the subpopulation only or the full population, using a pre-defined selection rule. A number of different methods to control the family wise error rate are implemented. Data are simulated for the early and final outcome measures, subpopulation prevalence and correlation between the final and the early outcomes.

<p>Simulations are run using the functions (i) <code>treatsel.sim</code> and (ii) <code>subpop.sim</code>. The other functions are not generally to be called by the user.
