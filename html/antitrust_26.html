<h2>“Bargaining” Classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Each class contains all the information needed to calibrate a specific type of demand system and
perform a merger simulation analysis under the assumption that firms are playing a differentiated products Nash Bargaining  game.
</p>
<p>The “Bargaining” class is a building block used to create other classes
in this package. As such, it is most likely to be useful for developers
who wish to code their own calibration/simulation routines.
</p>
<p>The “BargainingLogit” class has the information for a Nash Bargaining game with Logit demand.
</p>
<p>Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms below.
</p>
