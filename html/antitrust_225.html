<h2>Methods For Calculating Diversion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the diversion matrix between any two products in the market.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'Bertrand'
diversion(object, preMerger = TRUE, revenue = FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'AIDS'
diversion(object, preMerger = TRUE, revenue = TRUE)

## S4 method for signature 'VertBargBertLogit'
diversion(object, preMerger = TRUE, revenue = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of one of the classes listed above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preMerger</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, calculates pre-merger price elasticities. If
FALSE, calculates post-merger price elasticities. Default is TRUE.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>revenue</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, calculates revenue diversion. If
FALSE, calculates quantity diversion. Default is TRUE for ‘Bertrand’
and FALSE for ‘AIDS’.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For Bertrand, when ‘revenue’ is FALSE (the default),
this method uses the results from the merger calibration and
simulation to compute the <em>quantity</em> diversion matrix between any two products
in the market. Element i,j of this matrix is the quantity diversion from
product i to product j, or the
proportion of product i's sales that leave (go to) i for (from) j due
to a increase (decrease) in i's price. Mathematically, quantity diversion is
<code class="reqn">\frac{-\epsilon_{ji}share_j}{\epsilon_{ii}share_i}</code>,
where <code class="reqn">\epsilon_{ij}</code> is the cross-price elasticity from i to j.
</p>
<p>When ‘revenue’ is TRUE, this method computes the revenue diversion
matrix between any two products in the market. Element i,j of this matrix is the revenue diversion from
product i to product j, or the
proportion of product i's revenues that leave (go to) i for (from) j due
to a increase (decrease) in i's price. Mathematically, revenue diversion is
<code class="reqn">-\frac{\epsilon_{ji}(\epsilon_{jj}-1)r_j}{\epsilon_{jj}(\epsilon_{ii}-1)r_j}</code>
where <code class="reqn">r_i</code> is the revenue share of product i.
</p>
<p>When ‘preMerger’ is TRUE, diversions are
calculated at pre-merger equilibrium prices, and when ‘preMerger’ is FALSE, they
are calculated at post-merger equilibrium prices.
</p>
<p>For AIDS, when ‘revenue’ is TRUE (the default),
this method computes the <em>revenue</em> diversion matrix between any two
products in the market. For AIDS, the revenue diversion from i to j is
<code class="reqn">\frac{\beta_{ji}}{\beta_ij}</code>, where <code class="reqn">\beta_{ij}</code> is the
percentage change in product i's revenue due to a change in j's price.
</p>
<p>When ‘revenue’ is FALSE, this <code>callNextMethod</code> is invoked. Will
yield a matrix of NAs if the user did not supply prices.
</p>
<p>When ‘preMerger’ is TRUE, diversions are
calculated at pre-merger equilibrium prices, and when ‘preMerger’ is FALSE, they
are calculated at post-merger equilibrium prices.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a k x k matrix of diversion ratios, where the i,jth
element is the diversion from i to j.
