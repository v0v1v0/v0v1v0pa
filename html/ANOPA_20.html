<h2>emProportions: simple effect analysis of proportions.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function 'emProportions()' performs a <em>simple effect</em> analyses
of proportions after an omnibus analysis has been obtained with 'anopa()'
according to the ANOPA framework. Alternatively, it is also called an
<em>expected marginal</em> analysis of proportions. See Laurencelle and Cousineau (2023) for more.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">emProportions(w, formula)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
<p>An ANOPA object obtained from <code>anopa()</code>;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula which indicates what simple effect to analyze.
Only one simple effect formula at a time can be analyzed. The formula
is given using a vertical bar, e.g., " ~ factorA | factorB " to obtain
the effect of Factor A within every level of the Factor B.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>emProportions()</code> computes expected marginal proportions and
analyzes the hypothesis of equal proportion.
The sum of the _F_s of the simple effects are equal to the
interaction and main effect _F_s, as this is an additive decomposition
of the effects.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An ANOPA table of the various simple main effets and if relevant,
of the simple interaction effets.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# -- FIRST EXAMPLE --
# This is a basic example using a two-factors design with the factors between 
# subjects. Ficticious data present the number of success according
# to Class (three levels) and Difficulty (two levels) for 6 possible cells
# and 72 observations in total (equal cell sizes of 12 participants in each group).
twoWayExample

# As seen the data are provided in a compiled format (one line per group).
# Performs the omnibus analysis first (mandatory):
w &lt;- anopa( {success;total} ~ Difficulty * Class, twoWayExample) 
summary(w)

# The results shows an important interaction. You can visualize the data
# using anopaPlot:
anopaPlot(w)
# The interaction is overadditive, with a small differences between Difficulty
# levels in the first class, but important differences between Difficulty for 
# the last class.

# Let's execute the simple effect of Difficulty for every levels of Class
e &lt;- emProportions(w, ~ Difficulty | Class )
summary(e)


# -- SECOND EXAMPLE --
# Example using the Arrington et al. (2002) data, a 3 x 4 x 2 design involving 
# Location (3 levels), Trophism (4 levels) and Diel (2 levels), all between subject.
ArringtonEtAl2002

# first, we perform the omnibus analysis (mandatory):
w &lt;- anopa( {s;n} ~ Location * Trophism * Diel, ArringtonEtAl2002) 
summary(w)

# There is a near-significant interaction of Trophism * Diel (if we consider
# the unadjusted p value, but you really should consider the adjusted p value...).
# If you generate the plot of the four factors, we don't see much:
anopaPlot(w)

#... but a plot specifically of the interaction helps:
anopaPlot(w, ~ Trophism * Diel )
# it seems that the most important difference is for omnivorous fishes
# (keep in mind that there were missing cells that were imputed but there does not
# exist to our knowledge agreed-upon common practices on how to impute proportions...
# Are you looking for a thesis topic?).

# Let's analyse the simple effect of Trophism for every levels of Diel and Location
e &lt;- emProportions(w, ~ Trophism | Diel )
summary(e)


# You can ask easier outputs with
corrected(w) # or summary(w) for the ANOPA table only
explain(w)   # human-readable ouptut ((pending))
