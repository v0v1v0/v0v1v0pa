<h2>Propagate an orbital state vector with the SGP4/SDP4 model
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given an orbital state vector of a satellite, applies the SGP4 or SDP4 model to
propagate its orbit to the desired time point, as appropriate depending on the
orbital period. The model will be automatically chosen depending on the
orbital period. For objects in deep space (with orbital periods larger than
225 minutes, equivalent to altitudes higher than 5877.5 km) the SDP4 model will
be applied. For objects near Earth (orbital periods shorter than 225 minutes, or
altitudes lower than 5877.5 km) the SGP4 model will be used. It is not
recommended to apply SGP4 to objects in deep space or SDP4 to objects near
Earth, but this can be forced by calling directly the <code>sgp4</code> and
<code>sdp4</code> functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sgdp4(n0, e0, i0, M0, omega0, OMEGA0, Bstar, initialDateTime=NULL, targetTime,
      keplerAccuracy=10e-12, maxKeplerIterations=10)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean motion of the satellite at epoch in radians/min.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean eccentricity of the orbit of the satellite at epoch.
Eccentricity ranges from 0 (perfectly circular orbit) to 1 (parabolic
trajectory).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>i0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean orbital inclination of the satellite at epoch in radians.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean anomaly of the satellite at epoch.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>omega0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean argument of perigee of the satellite at epoch.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>OMEGA0</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mean longitude of the ascending node of the satellite at epoch.
Also known as right ascension of the ascending node.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Bstar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Drag coefficient of the satellite in units of (earth radii)^-1^.
Bstar is an adjusted value of the ballistic coefficient of the satellite, and
it indicates how susceptible it is to atmospheric drag.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initialDateTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>Date-time string in UTC indicating the time
corresponding to the known state vector of the satellite. It must be provided
for objects in deep space, and also for objects near Earth if <code>targetTime</code>
is provided as a date-time string.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>targetTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>Time at which the position and velocity of the satellite
should be calculated. It can be provided in two different ways: either as
a number corresponding to the time in minutes counting from epoch at which
the orbit should be propagated, or as a date-time string in UTC, in which case
the date-time string for epoch must be provided through <code>initialDateTime</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keplerAccuracy</code></td>
<td>
<p>Accuracy to consider Kepler´s equation solved. If two
consecutive solutions differ by a value lower than this accuracy, integration
is considered to have converged.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxKeplerIterations</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of iterations after which fixed-point
integration of Kepler's equation will stop, even if convergence according to
the accuracy criterion has not been reached.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with three elements. The first two elements represent the position and
velocity of the satellite at the target time, in the TEME (True Equator, Mean
Equinox) frame of reference. Position values are in km, and velocity values are
in km/s. Each of these two elements contains three values, corresponding to the
X, Y and Z components of position and velocity in this order. The third element
indicates the algorithm used to propagate the orbit (sgp4 or sdp4).
