<h2>Convert week numbers to dates or aweek objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are vectorized functions that take integer vectors and return Date or
an aweek objects, making it easier to convert bare weeks to dates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_aweek(
  week = 1L,
  year = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"),
  day = 1L,
  start = week_start,
  week_start = get_week_start(),
  ...
)

get_date(
  week = 1L,
  year = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"),
  day = 1L,
  start = get_week_start()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>week</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector, defaults to 1, representing the first week of the year.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>year</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector, defaults to the current year</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>day</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector, defaults to 1, representing the first day of
the first week of the year.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer (or character) vector of days that the weeks
start on for each corresponding week. Defaults to the value of
<code>get_week_start()</code>. Note that these will not determine the final week.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>week_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number indicating the start of the week based on the ISO
8601 standard from 1 to 7 where 1 = Monday OR an abbreviation of the
weekdate in an English or current locale. <em>Note: using a non-English locale
may render your code non-portable.</em> Defaults to the value of
<code>get_week_start()</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>parameters passed on to <code>date2week()</code></p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> get_aweek(): an aweek object
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> get_date(): a Date object
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Any missing weeks, years, or start elements will result in a
missing element in the resulting vector. Any missing days will
revert to the first day of the week.

<h3>Examples</h3>
