<h2>A3 Error Metrics for Predictive Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package for the generation of accurate, accessible, and
adaptable error metrics for developing high quality
predictions and inferences. The name A3 (pronounced "A-Cubed")
comes from the combination of the first letters of these three
primary adjectives.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The overarching purpose of the outputs and tools in this package
are to make the accurate assessment of model errors more
accessible to a wider audience. Furthermore, a standardized set
of reporting features are provided by this package which create
consistent outputs for virtually any predictive model. This makes
it straightforward to compare, for instance, a linear regression model
to more exotic techniques such as Random forests or Support
vector machines.
</p>
<p>The standard outputs for each model fit provided by the A3 package
include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Average Slope: Equivalent to a linear regression coefficient.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Cross Validated <code class="reqn">R^2</code>: Robust calculation of <code class="reqn">R^2</code> (percent of squared error explained by the model compared to the null model) values adjusting for over-fitting.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> p Values: Robust calculation of p-values requiring no parametric assumptions other than independence between observations (which may be violated if compensated for).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary functions that will be used are
<code>a3</code> for arbitrary modeling functions and
<code>a3.lm</code> for linear models. This package also
includes <code>print.A3</code> and <code>plot.A3</code>
for outputting the A3 results.
