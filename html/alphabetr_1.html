<h2>Identify candidate alpha/beta pairs.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>bagpipe()</code> uses the alphabetr resampling procedure on sequencing data
to identify candidate alpha/beta pairs. The procedure takes a subsample of
the data without replacement, calculates association scores with
<code>chain_scores</code>, and then for each well, uses the Hungarian
algorithm to determine the most likely pairings for the chains found in the
well. Each time this is done is a replicate, and the number of replicates is
specified as an option. A threshold is then used to filter the candidate
pairs that appear in proportion of the replicates larger than the threshold,
resulting in the final list of candidate pairs. Bagpipe is an acronym for
<strong>b</strong>ootstrapping <strong>a</strong>lphabetr <strong>g</strong>enerated
<strong>p</strong>a<strong>i</strong>rs <strong>p</strong>rocedur<strong>e</strong> (based on older versions
that utilized bootstrapping)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bagpipe(alpha, beta, replicates = 100, frac = 0.75, bootstrap = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix recording which alpha chains appear in each well of the
data. See <code>create_data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>beta</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix recording which beta chains appear in the each well of the
data. See <code>create_data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replicates</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of times the resampling procedure is repeated,
i.e. the number of replicates. At least 100 replicates is recommended.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>frac</code></td>
<td>
<p>The fraction of the wells resampled in each replicate. Default
is 75% of the wells</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootstrap</code></td>
<td>
<p>Legacy option. Calls a bootstrapping strategy (which
resamples with replacement) instead of sampling a subset without
replacement.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A n x 5 matrix where n is the number of clones determined by
<code>bagpipe()</code>. Each row represents the chains of the clone.
Columns 1 and 2 represent the beta chain indices of the clone.
Columns 3 and 4 represent the alpha chain indices of the clone.
Column 5 represents the number of replicates that this clone was found in.
Column 5 is used to filter our the clones that have not be determined by
a certain "threshold" proportion of replicates.
</p>
<p>Note that column 1 == column 2 and column 3 == column 4 since
<code>bagpipe()</code> does not try to determine dual-alpha or dual-beta clones.
</p>
