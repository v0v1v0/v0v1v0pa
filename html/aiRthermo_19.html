Data for plotting the lines of the thermodynamic (STUVE) diagram
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The vectors included in the list are: both components of the pseudoadiabatic lines (adiabatic_x_T, and adiabatic_y_T), labels of the pseudoadiabatic lines (adiabatic_z_T), both components of the dry adiabatic lines (theta_x_T and theta_y_T), both components of the constant mixing ratio lines (wsat_x_T and wsat_y_T) and their labels (wsat_z_T). The X components are provided in Celsius and the Y components in hPa. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(fixedlines)</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The pseudoadiabatic lines were calculated by the authors for this R-package following pseudoadiabatic evolutions from 1050 hPa. 
</p>
<p>The dry adiabatic lines were obtained using the functions in <em>aiRthermo</em> for different initial conditions and for a fixed set of initial potential temperatures. A similar procedure was applied on the calculation of the constant mixing ratio lines, starting from different values of saturation mixing ratio.
