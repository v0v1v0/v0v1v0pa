<h2>Sample on raising taxes from the 2008 National Annenberg Election Studies.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 2008 National Annenberg Election Studies (NAES) item (CBb01) asked: "I'm
going to read you some options about federal income taxes. Please tell me
which one comes closest to your view on what we should be doing about federal
income taxes: (1) Cut taxes; (2) Keep taxes as they are; (3) Raise taxes if
necessary; (4) None of these; (998) Don't know; (999) No answer. Category (3)
was turned into a 'raise taxes response,' categories (1) and (2) were
combined into a 'do not raise taxes' response. The original item from the
phone and online surveys contains 50,483 respondents. This sample mimics a
typical national survey. It contains at least 5 respondents from each state
but is otherwise a random sample.
