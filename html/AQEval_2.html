<h2>Air Quality Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>R AQEval: R code for the analysis of discrete
change in Air Quality time-series.
</p>


<h3>AQEval</h3>

<p><code>AQEval</code> was developed for use by those tasked with
the routine detection, characterisation and quantification
of discrete changes in air quality time-series.
</p>
<p>The main functions, <code>quantBreakPoints</code>
and <code>quantBreakSegments</code>, use
break-point/segment (BP/S) methods
based on the consecutive use of methods in the
<code>strucchange</code> and <code>segmented</code> <code>R</code> packages
to first detection (as break-points) and then characterise
and quantify (as segments), discrete changes in
air-quality time-series.
</p>
<p><code>AQEval</code> functions adopt an <code>openair</code>-friendly
approach using function and data structures that many
in the air quality research community are already familiar
with.
Most notably, most functions expect supplied data
to be time-series, to be supplied as a single
<code>data.frame</code> (or similar R object), and for
time-series to be identified by column names.
The main functions are typically structured expect
first the <code>data.frame</code>, then the name of the
pollutant to be used, then other arguments:
</p>
<p><code>function(data, "polluant.name", ...)</code>
</p>
<p><code>output &lt;- function(data, "polluant.name", ...)</code>
</p>
