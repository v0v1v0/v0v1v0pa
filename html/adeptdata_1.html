<h2>Outdoor Run Raw Accelerometry Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Raw accelerometry data collected during 25 minutes of an
outdoor run. Data were collected at frequency 100 Hz simultaneously with
two wearable accelerometers located at left hip and left ankle.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">acc_running
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with 300000 observations of 5 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>loc_id</code> - sensor location, one of: <code>"left_hip"</code>, <code>"left_ankle"</code>,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>date_time</code> - date and time of acceleration measurement collection stored as <code>POSIXct</code>,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>x</code> - acceleration measurement time-series collected from a "x" axis of the sensor accelerometer,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>y</code> - acceleration measurement time-series collected from a "y" axis of the sensor accelerometer,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>z</code> - acceleration measurement time-series collected from a "z" axis of the sensor accelerometer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data were collected during 25 minutes of an
outdoor run performed by an adult healthy female, 180 cm tall and of 67 kg weight
</p>
<p>The data were collected at frequency 100 Hz with two
ActiGraph GT9X Link sensors. One of the sensors was attached to the shoe with a clip
on the outside side of a left foot, just below the left ankle. The other sensor
was attached to the elastic belt located at hip, on the left side of a hip.
</p>
<p>Based on a mobile tracking application output, the ground elevation difference between
start and end point of the data collection is approximately 36 m (17 m at
the start point, 53 m at the finish point). The distance covered is approximately 3.35 km.
</p>
<p>The person from which the data were collected is Marta Karas, a co-author of the package.
The IRB Office Determination Request Form for Primary (New) Data Collection
request form was submitted in regard to the collection and further publishing of
these data. Based on preliminary review of the
request form submitted, it was determined that the data collection and further data publishing
activity described in the determination request does not qualify as human subjects research as
defined by DHHS regulations 45 CFR 46.102, and does not require IRB oversight.
