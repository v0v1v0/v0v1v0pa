<h2>Datasets from Hosmer, Lemeshow and Sturdivant, "Applied Logistic
Regression" (3rd ed., 2013)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is an unofficial companion to the textbook "Applied
Logistic Regression" by D.W. Hosmer, S. Lemeshow and
R.X. Sturdivant (3rd ed., 2013).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It includes all the datasets used in the book, both for easy
reproducibility and algorithms benchmarking purposes.
</p>
<p>Some analysis proposed in the text are reproduced in the examples,
in order to provide data testing and code demos at the same time.
</p>
<p>The vignette includes all the examples (with graphics too); therefore is
organized per-dataset.
</p>
<p>Datasets and variables have lower-case name with respect to the
original sources. Categorical data were packaged as factor.
</p>
<p>Regarding data coding, help pages list the internal/factor representation
of the data (eg 1: No, 2: Yes), not the original one (eg 0: No, 1:
Yes). This is intended to allow easier/safer recoding based on
as.integer, especially for multinomial variables.
