<h2>Shiny App to Explore Properties of Sampling Distributions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An interactive Shiny app to demonstrate properties of the sampling distributions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">shiny_sampling()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The interactive Shiny app demonstrates the properties of the sampling distribution.
The true population parameter values of the Normal distribution are provided by the user.
The user draws many samples from the population with the given sample characteristics
and explore the variability of sample means.
The app also includes the construction of 95% confidence interval for all samples.
Altering the population and sample characteristics, the user can explore
the influence of these changes on the sampling distribution.
</p>
<p>The left panel includes the user inputs for <strong>Simulation Features</strong>, <strong>Population Parameters</strong>,
<strong>Sample Characteristics</strong> and <strong>Distribution Function</strong>.
To use the app at first instance, just click the <code>Update</code> button.
To alter the input values, edit the text box or move the point on the slider and
explores the changes in different tabs (see below).
</p>
<p>To obtain identical outcomes in a separate run of the app,
set a common seed value at the bottom of the left panel and click <code>Update</code>.
All subsequent updates will produce identical results provided other inputs are identical.
The seed value is ignored when the option <code>check the box to update instantly</code> is selected.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The outcomes are presented in several tabs.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Population &amp; Sample</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the density plots of the population and
dot plot of the sample units for the first sample randomly drawn from the population.
It also includes the population parameter values are chosen by the user as well as
estimates of sample mean and standard deviation based on the first sample.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sampling Distribution</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains a panel of 8 dot plots based on the sample drawn
randomly from the population with given parameters.
Each plot depicts the mean and standard deviation of the random sample.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sample Estimators</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the histogram of the observed sample means and
the empirical distribution of sample means. It also includes the rug plot of all sample means.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Confidence Interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>contains the plot showing the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of all samples.
The plot shows the true population mean as a red horizontal line.
It also provides the exact number of these estimated CI that include the true population mean.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Summary</code></td>
<td>
<p>includes the summary of the sampled data and outcomes
from the one-sample z-test. Different sections are:
(1) Sample, tabulating the full sampled data;
(2) Sample Distribution, highlighting the expection of sample mean and sample standard deviation
as well as standard error of mean;
(3) Confidence Interval, showing the concept of 95% confidence intervals (CI) of mean.</p>

</p>
<p>Also note that under the central limit theorem, the distribution of the sample means will follow normal distribution
whatever the distribution of the variable in the population.
