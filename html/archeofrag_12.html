<h2>Admixture of two stratigraphic layers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Evaluate how reliable the distinction is between the two layers (or any other type of archaeological spatial units).</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">frag.layers.admixture(graph, layer.attr)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>An undirected <code>igraph</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>layer.attr</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. The name of the vertex attribute giving the layer of each fragment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns a value reflecting the robustness of the distinction between two layers (or any other relevant archaeological spatial unit).
The admixture value is computed as:
</p>
<p><code>1 - cohesion(layer 1) - cohesion(layer 2)</code>
</p>
<p>The admixture of two layers is equal to the cohesion of a virtual third layer, which is defined by the fragments and the connection relationships intersecting the two layers. 
Results range in [0;1] with 0 for two completely independent layers and values towards 1 as the robustness of the boundary between the two layers is lower.
As it appears, this function calls the <code>frag.layers.cohesion</code> function.
</p>
<p>The basic use of this function is intended for a graph with two layers, whose edges have been previously weighted using the <code>frag.edges.weighting</code> function (an error message is displayed if the vertice attribute "layer" contains less than two layers, and if the graph does not have an edge attribute "weight").
</p>
<p>However, the function can also be used for a graph with more than two layers. In this case, a subgraph is generated for each pair of layers (using the <code>frag.get.layers.pair</code> function), the <code>frag.edges.weighting</code> function is applied to weight their edges (a warning message is displayed), and the admixture is computed.
</p>
<p>An error message is displayed if the vertex "layer" attribute has less than two layers.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the admixture of each pair of layers.
