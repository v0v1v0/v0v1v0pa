<h2>Example 1 High quality data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is sample data copied from allelematch::amExampleData in version 5.2.1
of package allelematch. We use this data to test allelematch backwards compatibility.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with samples in rows, and alleles in columns. Missing data is represented as "-99".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data in this example is simulated to represent a high quality data set that might
result from a laboratory protocol where samples were run multiple times to confirm their
identity. It has no genotyping error, a near-zero missing data load, and approximately
60% of the individuals have been artificially resampled more than once.
