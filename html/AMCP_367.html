<h2>The data used in Chapter 14, Table 3</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data used in Chapter 14, Table 3
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(chapter_14_table_3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with 10 rows and 3 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Using the data in Table 14.1, we could average scores for each participant individually because the noise factor we need to average over is a within-subjects factor. For example, participant 1's average 0 degree score is 450, whereas his or her 8 degree score is 630. This participant's reaction time averages 180 msec longer (630 vs 450) for the 8 degree condition than the 0 degree condition. If the other 9 participants' data show a similar pattern, we would infer that there is indeed a main effect due to angle.
</p>
<p>For the hypothetical data contained in Table 14.1, Table 14.3 gives the set of D variables. The D variables are subsequently used to analyze the data given in Table 14.1. Recall that we analyzed the data contained in Table 14.1 directly using SPSS without (explicitly) forming D variables. Although obtaining the results of the main effects is easily accomplished using the data directly, forming and then analyzing D variables directly also has its benefits (which are delineated in the chapter). Below we analyze the D variables contained in Table 14.3. As expected, our results will match those previously obtained when we analyzed the raw data (i.e., skipping the step of explicitly forming D variables). However, the method to be outlined here provides a different way to accomplish the same goal. We will soon see that analyzing the data by explicitly forming D variables has its advantages.The first column of Table 14.3 (D1) shows these scores for all 10 participants. Indeed, all 10 participants have an average 8 degree reaction time that is slower than their average 0 degree reaction time. Such consistency strongly supports the existence of an angle main effect.
