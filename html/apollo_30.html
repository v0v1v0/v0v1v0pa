<h2>Keeps only the first row for each individual</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a multi-row input, keeps only the first row for each individual.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">apollo_firstRow(P, apollo_inputs)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of vectors, matrices or 3-dim arrays. Likelihood of the model components (or other object).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>apollo_inputs</code></td>
<td>
<p>List grouping most common inputs. Created by function apollo_validateInputs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This a function to keep only the first row of an object per indidividual. It can handle multiple types of components, including scalars, vectors and three-dimensional arrays (cubes).
The argument database MUST contain a column called 'apollo_sequence', which is created by apollo_validateData.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>P</code> is a list, then it returns a list where each element has only the first row of each individual.
If <code>P</code> is a single element, then it returns a single element with only the first row of each individual.
The size of the element is changed only in the first dimension. If input is a scalar, then it returns a vector with the element repeated as many
times as individuals in <code>database</code>. If the element is a vector, its length will be changed to the number of individuals. If the element is
a matrix, then its first dimension will be changed to the number of individuals, while keeping the size of the second dimension. If the element 
is a cube, then only the first dimension's length is changed, preserving the others.
