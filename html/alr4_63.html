<h2>
Subjective scaling data collected by S. S. Stevens
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This experiment was apparently done by S. S. Stevens and colleagues in March 1962,
although the exact reference is lost.  10 subjects were played tones at each of
5 loudnesses, presumably in random order.  Subjects were asked to
draw a line on paper whose length matched the loudness of the tone.  Each
subject repeated each loudness 3 times, for a total of 30 trials per subject.
The original data are lost; reported here is the mean of the 3 log-lengths for
each loudness, the sd of the three log-lengths, and the number of replications,
which is always 3.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Stevens)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 50 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>subject</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with unique values for each subject</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>loudness</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>either 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 db.
Decibels are a logrithmic scale</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector giving the mean of the log-lengths of
three lines drawn.  Exponentiating these values would give the geometric mean
of the three lengths in cm.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sd</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, giving the sd of the three log lengths</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>n</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, equal to the constant value 3</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a classic example of a psychophysics experiment pioneered by S. S.
Stevens.  The basic idea is that the phychological response y to a physical
stimulus x should be proportional to x to a power.  Since both the response
and the loudness are already in log-scale, linear fits should be expected.
