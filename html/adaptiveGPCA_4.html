<h2>A subset of the antibiotic data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a smaller version of the <code>AntibioticPhyloseq</code> dataset,
for use in the examples so that the running time isn't so long. It
has the same samples and a randomly selected set of 200 of the
taxa. It is stored as a list with three components: the normalized
OTU abundances (<code>X</code>), the similarity matrix for the taxa
(<code>Q</code>), and the diagonal weight matrix (<code>D</code>, the identity
matrix).

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with three components.</p>
