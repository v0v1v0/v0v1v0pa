<h2>Gene/Drug response dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>P-values and ordering of genes drawn from a microarray dataset, consisting of 22283 genes on breast cancer cells in response to estrogen, from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through 'GEOquery' package, with index "GDS2324".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">estrogen
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with 22283 rows and 3 columns.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original dataset "GDS2324" consists of gene expression measurements for n = 22283 genes, in response to estrogen treatments in breast cancer cells for five groups of patients, with different dosage levels and 5 trials in each. The task is to identify the genes responding to a low dosage. The p-value for gene i is obtained by a one-sided permutation test which evaluates evidence for a change in gene expression level between the control group (placebo) and the low-dose group. The p-values are then ordered according to permutation t-statistics comparing the control and low-dose data, pooled, against data from a higher dosage (with genes that appear to have a strong response at higher dosages placed earlier in the list).
</p>
<p>Two orderings are considered: first, a stronger (more informative) ordering based on a comparison to the highest dosage; and second, a weaker (less informative) ordering based on a comparison to a medium dosage.
</p>
<p>The variables are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> pvals. p-values
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ord_high. stronger ordering
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ord_mod. weaker ordering
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The R code to produce the data can be found in '/extdata/estrogen_get_pvals.R'.
