<h2>Three stage group sequential adaptive design with subgroup selection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ASSISTant</code> is a package that implements a three-stage
adaptive clinical trial design with provision for subgroup
selection where the treatment may be effective; see Lai, Lavori and
Liao (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2014.09.001">doi:10.1016/j.cct.2014.09.001</a>). The main design object is
an <code>R6</code> class that can be instantiated and manipulated to
obtain the operating characteristics. A vignette is provided
showing the use of this package for designing the DEFUSE-3 trial,
described in the paper by Lai, Lavori and Liao. The package
contains everything necessary to reproduce the results of the
paper.
