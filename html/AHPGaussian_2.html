<h2>New Multicriteria Method: AHPGaussian</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a method allowing individuals or groups to make complex decisions. The core concept of AHP is that alternatives are always compared pairwise (and not, say, by giving a score, or sorting alternatives). AHP is used in many fields, from finance to criminal investigation.
</p>
<p>The AHP Gaussian is a modification of the AHP that uses a Gaussian function to model the pairwise comparisons between criteria and alternatives. In the traditional AHP, pairwise comparisons are made using numerical values on a scale from 1 to 9, which can be subjective and lead to inconsistencies. The AHP Gaussian addresses this issue by using a continuous function that allows for more precise and consistent comparisons.
</p>
<p>The function is defined by a mean value and a standard deviation, which can be estimated from the pairwise comparison data. The resulting weights for the criteria and alternatives are obtained by solving a system of linear equations. The Gaussian AHP has been shown to be effective in various applications, including military decision-making and environmental management.
