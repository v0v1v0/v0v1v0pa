<h2>adaptiveGPCA: A package for structured dimensionality reduction</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements the methods for structured dimensionality
reduction described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00501">Fukuyama, J. (2017)</a>. The
general idea is to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the
data, similar to that given by PCA, which incorporates side
information about the relationships between the variables. The
output is similar to a PCA biplot, but the variable loadings are
regularized so that similar variables are encouraged to have
similar loadings on the principal axes.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are two main ways of using this package. The function
<code>adaptivegpca</code> will choose how much to regularize the
variables according to the similarities between them, while the
function <code>gpcaFullFamily</code> produces analogous output for
a range of regularization parameters. With this function, the
results for the different regularization parameters are inspected
with the <code>visualizeFullFamily</code> function, and the
desired parameter is chosen manually.
</p>
<p>The package also contains functionality to integrate with phyloseq:
the function <code>processPhyloseq</code> takes a
<code>phyloseq</code> object and creates the inputs
necessary to perform adaptive gPCA on a microbiome dataset
including information about the phylogenetic relationships between
the bacteria.
