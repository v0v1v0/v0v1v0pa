<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Learning to Rank Bagging Workflows with Metalearning
</p>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully applied to a
wide range of domains and applications. One of the techniques
behind most of these successful applications is Ensemble Learning (EL),
the field of ML that gave birth to methods such as Random Forests
or Boosting. The complexity of applying these techniques together
with the market scarcity on ML experts, has created the need for
systems that enable a fast and easy drop-in replacement for ML libraries.
Automated machine learning (autoML) is the field of ML that attempts
to answers these needs. Typically, these systems rely on optimization
techniques such as bayesian optimization to lead the search for the
best model. Our approach differs from these systems by making use of
the most recent advances on metalearning and a learning to rank
approach to learn from metadata. We propose autoBagging, an autoML
system that automatically ranks 63 bagging workflows by exploiting
past performance and dataset characterization. Results on 140
classification datasets from the OpenML platform show that autoBagging
can yield better performance than the Average Rank method and achieve
results that are not statistically different from an ideal model that
systematically selects the best workflow for each dataset.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">autoBagging(form, data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>form</code></td>
<td>
<p>formula. Currently supporting only categorical target
variables (classification tasks)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>training dataset with a categorical target variable</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The underlying model leverages the performance of the workflows
in historical data. It ranks and recommends workflows for a given
classification task. A bagging workflow is comprised by the following steps:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>generation</dt>
<dd>
<p>the number of trees to grow</p>
</dd>
<dt>pruning</dt>
<dd>
<p>the pruning of low performing trees in the ensemble</p>
</dd>
<dt>pruning cut-point</dt>
<dd>
<p>a parameter of the previous step</p>
</dd>
<dt>dynamic selection</dt>
<dd>
<p>the dynamic selection method used
to aggregate predictions. If none is recommended, majority voting
is used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an <code>abmodel</code> class object
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# splitting an example dataset into train/test:
train &lt;- iris[1:(.7*nrow(iris)), ]
test &lt;- iris[-c(1:(.7*nrow(iris))), ]
# then apply autoBagging to the train, using the desired formula:
# autoBagging will compute metafeatures on the dataset
# and apply a pre-trained ranking model to recommend a workflow.
model &lt;- autoBagging(Species ~., train)
# predictions are produced with the standard predict method
preds &lt;- predict(model, test)

## End(Not run)
