<h2>Phylogeny and quantitative traits of flowers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set describes the phylogeny of 11 flowers as reported by Morales
(2000). It also gives morphologic and demographic traits corresponding to
these 11 species.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>tithonia</code> is a list containing the 2 following objects :
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>tre</dt>
<dd>
<p>is a character string giving the phylogenetic tree in
Newick format.</p>
</dd> <dt>tab</dt>
<dd>
<p>is a data frame with 11 species and 14 traits (6
morphologic traits and 8 demographic).</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Variables of <code>tithonia$tab</code> are the following ones : <br> morho1: is a
numeric vector that describes the seed size (mm)<br> morho2: is a numeric
vector that describes the flower size (mm)<br> morho3: is a numeric vector
that describes the female leaf size (cm)<br> morho4: is a numeric vector that
describes the head size (mm)<br> morho5: is a integer vector that describes
the number of flowers per head <br> morho6: is a integer vector that
describes the number of seeds per head <br> demo7: is a numeric vector that
describes the seedling height (cm)<br> demo8: is a numeric vector that
describes the growth rate (cm/day)<br> demo9: is a numeric vector that
describes the germination time<br> demo10: is a numeric vector that describes
the establishment (per cent)<br> demo11: is a numeric vector that describes
the viability (per cent)<br> demo12: is a numeric vector that describes the
germination (per cent)<br> demo13: is a integer vector that describes the
resource allocation<br> demo14: is a numeric vector that describes the adult
height (m)<br></p>
