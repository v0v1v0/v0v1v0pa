<h2>Prediction of antimicrobial peptides</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ancient and evolutionarily conserved 
molecules widespread in all living organisms that participate in host 
defence and/or microbial competition. Due to their positive charge, 
hydrophobicity and amphipathicity, they preferentially disrupt 
negatively-charged bacterial membranes. AMPs are considered an important 
alternative to traditional antibiotics, especially in times when the latter 
are drastically losing their effectiveness. Therefore, efficient computational 
tools for AMP prediction are essential to identify the best AMP candidates without 
undertaking expensive experimental studies. AmpGram is our novel tool for predicting 
AMPs based on the stacked random forests and n-gram analysis, able to
successfully predict antimicrobial peptides in proteomes.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>AmpGram is available as R function (<code>predict.ampgram_model</code>) or
shiny GUI (<code>AmpGram_gui</code>).
</p>
<p>AmpGram requires the external package, AmpGramModel, which 
contains models necessary to perform the prediction. The model 
can be installed using <code>install_AmpGramModel</code>
