<h2>Methods For Implementing The Hypothetical Monopolist Test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An Implementation of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test described in the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines.
</p>
<p><code>HypoMonTest</code> implements the Hypothetical Monopolist Test for a given ‘ssnip’.
</p>
<p><code>calcPricesHypoMon</code> computes prices for a subset of firms under the control of a hypothetical monopolist
under the specified demand function or auction.
</p>
<p><code>diversionHypoMon</code> calculates the matrix of revenue diversions between all products included in the
merger simulation, <em>irrespective of whether or not they are also included in ‘prodIndex’</em>.
</p>
<p><code>calcPriceDeltaHypoMon</code> computes the proportional difference in product prices between the
prices of products in ‘prodIndex’ (i.e. prices set by the
Hypothetical Monopolist) and prices set in the pre-merger equilibrium.
‘...’ may be used to pass arguments to the optimizer.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms playing the Bertrand pricing game above.
</p>
<p><code>HypoMonTest</code> is an implementation of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test
on the products indexed by ‘prodIndex’ for a ‘ssnip’. The
Hypothetical Monopolist Test determines whether a profit-maximizing
Hypothetical Monopolist who controls the products indexed by
‘prodIndex’ would increase the price of at least one of the merging parties' products in ‘prodIndex’ by a
small, significant, and non-transitory amount (i.e. impose a SSNIP).
</p>
<p><code>calcPriceDeltaHypoMon</code> calculates the price changes relative to (predicted) pre-merger prices that a
Hypothetical Monopolist would impose on the products indexed by ‘prodIndex’, holding the prices of products not
controlled by the Hypothetical Monopolist fixed at pre-merger levels. With the exception of ‘AIDS’, the
<code>calcPriceDeltaHypoMon</code> for all the classes listed above calls <code>calcPricesHypoMon</code> to compute price
levels. <code>calcPriceDeltaHypoMon</code> is in turn called by <code>HypoMonTest</code>.
</p>
<p><code>diversionHypoMon</code> calculates the matrix of revenue diversions between all products included in the merger simulation,
<em>irrespective</em> of whether or not they are also included in
‘prodIndex’. This matrix is useful for diagnosing whether or not a
product not included in ‘prodIndex’ may have a higher revenue diversion
either to or from a product included in ‘prodIndex’. Note that the ‘AIDS’
<code>diversionHypoMon</code> method does not contain the ‘prodIndex’
argument, as AIDS revenue diversions are only a function of demand parameters.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>HypoMonTest</code> returns TRUE if a profit-maximizing Hypothetical Monopolist who controls the products indexed by
‘prodIndex’ would increase the price of at least one of the merging
parties' products in ‘prodIndex’ by a ‘ssnip’, and
FALSE otherwise. <code>HypoMonTest</code> returns an error if ‘prodIndex’
does not contain at least one of the merging parties products.
</p>
<p><code>calcPriceDeltaHypoMon</code> returns a vector of proportional price changes for
all products placed under the control of the Hypothetical
Monopolist (i.e. all products indexed by ‘prodIndex’).
</p>
<p><code>calcPricesHypoMon</code> is identical, but for price levels.
</p>
<p><code>diversionHypoMon</code> returns a k x k matrix of diversions,
where element i,j is the diversion from product i to product j.
