<h3>The exposed funtions</h3>

<p>This package provides three functions which are linked between them and have to be used in the following way.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><b>ardeco_get_variable_list</b> - to recover the list of the avavilable variables with related descritpion.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>ardeco_get_dataset_list</b> - After having identified the variable of interest, it's possible to identify the list of datasets included into the variable of interest. This function return the list of the dimensions defined into the selected variable with the possible values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>ardeco_get_dataset_data</b> - To recover the data related to a variable it's possibile to do it by using just the variable code (recovering all variable data) or filtering it using unit, nuts version, levels, year, nutscode and all optional additional dimension (like sector, age, sex) recovered by ardeco_get_dataset_list.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ardeco_get_variable_list()
ardeco_get_dataset_list('SNPTN')
ardeco_get_dataset_data('SNPTN', version=2021, level='0', nutscode='LT', year='2020')
</code></pre>
