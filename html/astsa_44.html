<h2>fMRI - complete data set
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data (as a vector list) from an fMRI experiment in pain, listed  by location and stimulus.  The data are BOLD signals when a stimulus was applied for 32 seconds and then stopped for 32 seconds. The signal period is 64 seconds and the sampling rate was one observation every 2 seconds for 256 seconds (<code class="reqn">n = 128</code>).  The number of subjects under each condition varies.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The LOCATIONS of the brain where the signal was measured were [1] Cortex 1: Primary Somatosensory, Contralateral, [2] Cortex 2: Primary Somatosensory, Ipsilateral, [3] Cortex 3: Secondary Somatosensory, Contralateral, [4] Cortex 4: Secondary Somatosensory, Ipsilateral, [5] Caudate, [6] Thalamus 1: Contralateral, [7] Thalamus 2: Ipsilateral, [8] Cerebellum 1: Contralateral and [9] Cerebellum 2: Ipsilateral.
</p>
<p>The TREATMENTS or stimuli (and number of subjects in each condition) are [1] Awake-Brush (5 subjects), [2] Awake-Heat (4 subjects), [3] Awake-Shock (5 subjects), [4] Low-Brush (3 subjects), [5] Low-Heat (5 subjects), and [6] Low-Shock (4 subjects). Issue the command <code>summary(fmri)</code> for further details.  In particular, awake (Awake) or mildly anesthetized (Low) subjects  were subjected  levels of periodic brushing (Brush), application of heat (Heat), and mild shock (Shock) effects.
</p>
<p>As an example, <code>fmri$L1T6</code> (Location 1, Treatment 6) will show the data for the four subjects receiving the Low-Shock treatment at the Cortex 1 location; note that <code>fmri[[6]]</code> will display the same data.
