Data for Dutch wagtails
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Dutch Centre for Field Ornithology (Sovon) 
monitored grassland birds in Flevoland between April and mid-July 2011. 235 points were surveyed on up to 4 occasions; observations were divided into distance classes 50m wide, and the number of observations in each class recorded. These data are for the Yellow Wagtail (<em>Motacilla flava</em>).
</p>

<p>for each point, the percentage of the area under permanent grassland.</p>
</dd>
<dt>lscale </dt>
<dd>
<p>for each point, an index of whether the landscape is open (0) or closed (100).</p>
</dd>
<dt>date </dt>
<dd>
<p>a points x occasions matrix, the Julian date of the survey.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hour </dt>
<dd>
<p>a points x occasions matrix, the hour of the survey.</p>
</dd>
<dt>breaks </dt>
<dd>
<p>the boundaries between the distance classes; birds more than 300m from the point were not included.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Y </dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix of counts, with a row for each site; columns 1 to 6 give the counts in the distance classes for the 1st survey occasion, columns 7 to 12 for the 2nd occasion, and so on (this is the format required for <code>unmarkedFrameGDS</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>rep </dt>
<dd>
