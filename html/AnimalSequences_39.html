<h2>Create a Zipf's Law Plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates a log-log plot to visualize Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. The plot compares the observed frequency distribution of elements with the expected distribution if Zipf's law were true.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">zipf_plot(sequences_long)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequences_long</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing at least one column named ‘element' which represents the elements of sequences. Each element’s frequency is used to create the plot.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>- **Observed Frequencies**: Calculated from the provided 'sequences_long' data frame.
- **Expected Frequencies**: Calculated using Zipf's law formula, where the frequency of the element is inversely proportional to its rank.
- **Plotting**: Both observed and expected frequencies are plotted on a log-log scale to compare against Zipf's law.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ‘ggplot' object that visualizes the observed and expected frequencies of elements according to Zipf’s law. The plot includes:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Rank</code></td>
<td>
<p>The rank of each element based on its frequency, plotted on a log scale.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Count</code></td>
<td>
<p>The observed frequency of each element, plotted on a log scale.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Expected</code></td>
<td>
<p>The expected frequency of each element if Zipf's law were true, shown as a grey dashed line.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example data frame
sequences_long &lt;- data.frame(element = c('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'))

# Generate the Zipf's law plot
