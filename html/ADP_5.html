<h2>Calculates the predicted prevalence of users according to the triers' rate</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function develops a prediction of the users' rate of an innovation in
the market, according to the number of triers
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pusers(triers)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>triers</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of percentage (0&lt;triers&lt;1) of known triers</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates the rate of users in the population of a certain
innovation according to known triers rate in that population and measured in a survey.
</p>
<p>The measuring of triers is relatively easy. It is just a question of whether
a person tried a product even once in his life or not. While measuring the
rate of people who also adopt it as part of their life is more complicated
since the adoption of a product is a subjective view of the individual.
Mickey Kislev and Shira Kislev developed a formula to calculates the prevalence
of users of a product to overcome this difficulty. The current function
assists in calculating the users of a product based on the prevalence of
triers in the population.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector of predicted percentage (0&lt;users&lt;1) of users in the population of a certain innovation according to known triers rate

<pre><code class="language-R"># 50% rate of triers
pusers(0.5)
0.2455041
# means that 24.5% of the population uses the product regularly, in case
# that 50% of the population already tried it.
