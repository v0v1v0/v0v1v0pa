<h2>Toy Life History Data having Directions of Recession</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Toy life history data created to exhibit the phenomenon of directions
of recession.   It was analyzed in a special topics course on aster models
Fall 2018.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(foobar)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>data(foobar)</code> loads four R objects.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>fam</dt>
<dd>
<p>a vector of family indices.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pred</dt>
<dd>
<p>a vector of predecessor indices.</p>
</dd>
<dt>vars</dt>
<dd>
<p>a vector of variable names associated with the nodes
of the aster graph.</p>
</dd>
<dt>redata</dt>
<dd>
<p>a data frame having data on 300 individuals, each of
which has <code>length(vars) == 4</code> components of fitness,
so the aster graph for one individual has four nodes.  This data
frame is already in long format; no need to <code>reshape</code>.
The variables in this data frame are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>resp</dt>
<dd>
<p>the response vector.</p>
</dd>
<dt>varb</dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical.  Gives node of graphical model corresponding
to each component of <code>resp</code>.  See details below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>root</dt>
<dd>
<p>All ones.  Root variables for graphical model.</p>
</dd>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical.  Individual ID numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>trt</dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical.  Treatment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>blk</dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical.  Block.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Bernoulli (zero-or-one-valued).  Indicator variable
of the fitness nodes
of the graph; in these data there is just one node for fitness.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The levels of <code>varb</code> indicate nodes of the graphical model to which
the corresponding elements of the response vector <code>resp</code> belong.
This is the typical “long” format produced by the R <code>reshape</code>
function.  For each individual, there are several response variables.
All response variables are combined in one vector <code>resp</code>.
The variable <code>varb</code> indicates which “original” variable
the the corresponding component of the response vector was.
The variable <code>id</code> indicates which individual the corresponding
component of the response vector was.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(foobar)
library(aster)
aout &lt;- aster(resp ~ varb + fit : (trt * blk), pred,
    fam, varb, id, root, data = redata)
foo &lt;- try(summary(aout))
# gives an error about directions of recession
# get directions of recession
dor &lt;- attr(foo, "condition")$dor
dor
# found one apparent direction of recession
# from regular pattern
# it looks like a true direction of recession
dor &lt;- dor / max(abs(dor))
dor
# but what does it do?  For that need to map to saturated model
# parameter space
modmat &lt;- aout$modmat
dim(modmat)
# oof!  modmat is three-dimensional.  Need an actual matrix here.
modmat &lt;- matrix(as.vector(modmat), ncol = length(dor))
dor.phi &lt;- drop(modmat %*% dor)
names(dor.phi) &lt;- with(redata, paste(id, as.character(varb), sep = "."))
dor.phi[dor.phi != 0]
fam.default()[fam[vars == "seeds"]]
# since the support of the Poisson distribution is bounded above,
# actually this must be minus the DOR (if it is a DOR at all).
# check that all components of response vector for which dor.phi == 1 are zero
# (lower bound of Poisson range)
all(redata$resp[dor.phi == 1] == 0)
# so minus dor.phi is a true direction of recession in the saturated model
# canonical parameter space, and minus dor is a true direction of recession
# in the submodel canonical parameter space
#
# try to get more info
trt.blk &lt;- with(redata,
    paste(as.character(trt), as.character(blk), sep = "."))
unique(trt.blk[dor.phi == 1])
# the reason for the direction of recession is that every individual getting
# treatment a in block A had zero seeds.
#
# the reason the submodel DOR, R object dor, was so hard to interpret was
# because fit:trta:blkA is not in the model.  So let's force it in
redata &lt;- transform(redata, trt = relevel(trt, ref = "b"),
    blk = relevel(blk, ref = "B"))
# Note: following code is copied exactly from above.  Only difference
# is releveling in the immediately preceding statement
aout &lt;- aster(resp ~ varb + fit : (trt * blk), pred,
    fam, varb, id, root, data = redata)
foo &lt;- try(summary(aout))
dor &lt;- attr(foo, "condition")$dor
dor &lt;- dor / max(abs(dor))
dor
# now it is obvious from looking at this dor that all individuals in trt a
# and blk A are at the lower end (zero) of the Poisson range.
# maybe the other dor we had previously would be "obvious" to someone
# sufficiently skilled in understanding the meaning of regression coefficients
# but not "obvious" to your humble author
#
# as for what to do about this, see the course slides cited in the reference
# section.  There is no single Right Thing to do.
