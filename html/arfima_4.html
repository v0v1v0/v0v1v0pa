<h2>Simulate an ARFIMA time series.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function simulates an long memory ARIMA time series, with one of
fractionally differenced white noise (FDWN), fractional Gaussian noise
(FGN), power-law autocovariance (PLA) noise, or short memory noise and
possibly seasonal effects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">arfima.sim(
  n,
  model = list(phi = numeric(0), theta = numeric(0), dint = 0, dfrac = numeric(0), H =
    numeric(0), alpha = numeric(0), seasonal = list(phi = numeric(0), theta = numeric(0),
    dint = 0, period = numeric(0), dfrac = numeric(0), H = numeric(0), alpha =
    numeric(0))),
  useC = 3,
  sigma2 = 1,
  rand.gen = rnorm,
  muHat = 0,
  zinit = NULL,
  innov = NULL,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of points to be generated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>The model to be simulated from.  The phi and theta arguments
should be vectors with the values of the AR and MA parameters. Note that
Box-Jenkins notation is used for the MA parameters: see the "Details"
section of <code>arfima</code>.  The dint argument indicates how much
differencing should be required to make the process stationary.  The dfrac,
H, and alpha arguments are FDWN, FGN and PLA values respectively; note that
only one (or none) of these can have a value, or an error is returned. The
seasonal argument is a list, with the same parameters, and a period, as the
model argument. Note that with a seasonal model, we can have mixing of
FDWN/FGN/HD noise: one in the non-seasonal part, and the other in the
seasonal part.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useC</code></td>
<td>
<p>How much interfaced C code to use: an integer between 0 and 3.
The value 3 is strongly recommended. See the "Details" section of
<code>arfima</code>.</p>

<td>
<p>The desired variance for the innovations of the series.</p>
</td>

<p>The distribution of the innovations.  Any distribution
recognized by <code>R</code> is possible</p>

<p>The theoretical mean of the series before integration (if
integer integration is done)</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>Used for prediction; not meant to be used directly.  This
allows a start of a time series to be specified before inverse differencing
(integration) is applied.</p>

<td>
<p>Used for prediction; not meant to be used directly.  This

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A suitably defined stationary series is generated, and if either of the
dints (non-seasonal or seasonal) are greater than zero, the series is
integrated (inverse-differenced) with zinit equalling a suitable amount of
0s if not supplied.  Then a suitable amount of points are taken out of the
beginning of the series (i.e. dint + period * seasonal dint = the length of
zinit) to obtain a series of length n.  The stationary series is generated
by calculating the theoretical autovariance function and using it, along
with the innovations to generate a series as in McLeod et. al. (2007).
<em>Note:</em> if you would like to fit a function from a fitted arfima model,
the function <code>sim_from_fitted</code> can be used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A sample from a multivariate normal distribution that has a
covariance structure defined by the autocovariances generated for given
parameters.  The sample acts like a time series with the given parameters.
