<h2>Akaike-Adjusted R Squared Calculation with Model Averaging</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the adjusted R squared for each predictor using the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) and model averaging. AIC is used to compare the
performance of candidate models and select the best one. Then, the R squared
is adjusted based on the weight of evidence in favor of each model. The final
result is a long-format table of variable names and corresponding adjusted
R squared values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">akaike_adjusted_rsq(DF)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DF</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame containing the variables to calculate the adjusted
R squared for. The data.frame should include the columns:
"form", "AICc", "max_vif", "k", "DeltaAICc", "AICWeight", and "N".</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The adjusted R squared is calculated as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Adjusted R^2 = 1 - (RSS / (N - k - 1)) * ((N - 1) / (N - k - 1))</code>
</p>

<p>where RSS is the residual sum of squares, N is the sample size, and
k is the number of predictors. The R squared is adjusted based on the
weight of evidence in favor of each model, which is calculated as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">w_i = exp(-0.5 * DeltaAICc_i) / sum(exp(-0.5 * DeltaAICc))</code>
</p>

<p>where w_i is the weight of evidence in favor of the ith model, and
DeltaAICc_i is the difference in AICc between the ith model and the
best model. Model averaging uses the weights to combine the
performance of different models in the final calculation of the
adjusted R squared.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame with columns "Variable" and "Full_Akaike_Adjusted_RSq".
Each row represents a predictor, and its corresponding adjusted R
squared value based on the Akaike-adjusted model averaging process.
</p>
