<h2>Automated Forward Stepwise GLM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes in a dataframe and the dependent variable (in quotes) as arguments, splits the data into testing and training,
and uses automated forward stepwise selection to build a series of multiple regression models on the training data.
Each model is then evaluated on the test data and model evaluation metrics are computed for each model. These metrics
are provided as plots. Additionally, the model metrics are ranked and average rank is taken. The model with the lowest
average ranking among the metrics is displayed (along with its formula). By default, metrics are all given the same
relative importance (i.e., weights) when calculating average model metric rank, but if the user desires to give more
weight to one or more metrics than the others they can specify these weights as arguments (default for weights is 1).
As of v 0.2.0, only the family = gauissian(link = 'identity') argument is provided within the glm function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fwd_stepwise_glm(data, dv, aic_wt = 1, r_wt = 1, mae_wt = 1,
  r_squ_wt = 1, train_prop = 0.7, random_seed = 7)

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a plot for each metric by model and the best overall model with the formula used when fitting that model
