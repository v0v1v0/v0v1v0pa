<h2>R client for Digital Ocean</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is an R client for Digital Ocean's RESTful API,
and a set of scripts that allow you to install R, RStudio server, RStudio
Shiny server, or OpenCPU server, in addition to common packages used. The
goal here is to spin up a cloud R environment without leaving R, and
requiring no knowledge other than R. Of course if you are more experienced
you can log in on the command line and modify anything you want, but for
those that just want a quick cloud R environment, this
should be one of the easiest options.
</p>
<p>You need to authenticate to use this package. Get your auth token at
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens - See
<code>do_oauth</code> for more on authentication.
</p>


<h3>ssh keys</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">analogsea</span> allows you to interact with your droplet(s) from R via SSH.
To do this you need to setup SSH keys with Digital Ocean. Make sure you
provide Digitial Ocean your public key at
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/ssh_keys - GitHub has some good advice
on creating a new public key if you don't already have one:
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
</p>
<p>Note that when using ssh, you'll likely get warnings like "The authenticity
of host can't be established ...". This is normal, don't be worried about
this.
</p>
<p>Note that if you want to connect over SSH to a droplet you have to
create the droplet with an SSH key with the <code>ssh_keys</code> parameter.
If you don't you can still interact with the droplet via the Digital
Ocean API, but you can't access the droplet over SSH.
