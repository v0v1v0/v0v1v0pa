ACTCD: Asymptotic Classification Theory for Cognitive Diagnosis
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cluster analysis for cognitive diagnosis based on the Asymptotic Classification Theory (Chiu, Douglas &amp; Li, 2009). 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cognitive Diagnosis aims primarily to obtain examinees' mastery or non-mastery on a set of attributes or skills of interest, based on their responses to test items and a pre-specified Q-matrix (Tatsuoka, 1985). The Asymptotic Classification Theory (Chiu, Douglas &amp; Li, 2009) provides mathematical grounds for cognitive diagnosis using cluster analysis. 
</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, given the responses of <code class="reqn">N</code> examinees to a test of <code class="reqn">J</code> items with <code class="reqn">K</code> attributes, let <code class="reqn">\bm{W}=(W_{1}, W_{2},\ldots, W_{K})'</code> be a vector of summed scores on the <code class="reqn">K</code> attributes, where the <code class="reqn">k_{th}</code> component is defined as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">W_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{J}Y_{j}q_{jk},</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">Y_j</code> is the vector of responses of the <code class="reqn">j^{th}</code> examinee and <code class="reqn">q_{jk}</code> is the <code class="reqn">(j,k)</code> entry of the Q-matrix. The sample statistic <code class="reqn">\bm{W}</code> is then taken as the input for cluster analysis, such as <em>K</em>-means (MacQueen, 1976) and Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster Analysis (HACA; Hartigan, 1975). This theory indicated that given two different attribute patterns <code class="reqn">\bm{\alpha}</code> and <code class="reqn">\bm{\alpha}^*</code>, the corresponding conditional expectations, <code class="reqn">E[\bm{W}|\bm{\alpha}]</code> and <code class="reqn">E[\bm{W}|\bm{\alpha}^*]</code>, will be distinct, implying that with <code class="reqn">\bm{W}</code> as the input, cluster analysis will group subjects correctly as the number of items is sufficiently large. Refer to Chiu, Douglas and Li (2009) for details about this theory. Because cluster analysis does not provide labels for the clusters, various labeling methods (Chiu &amp; Ma, 2013) have been developed to obtain the attribute profiles .
</p>
<p>The package <code>ACTCD</code> is an easy-to-use tool. The responses matrix and Q-matrix (Tatsuoka, 1985) are required by the main function of this package, <code>npar.CDM</code>, and the examinees' attribute profiles can be obtained directly using user-specified clustering and labeling methods. It is also possible to conduct cluster analysis without labeling algorithm using function <code>cd.cluster</code> based on HACA or <em>K</em>-means. The labeling algorithms can be employed by <code>labeling</code> separately.
