<p>PAL is computed by dividing total energy expenditure (TEE) by BMR. TEE is obtained by summing
the kilocalories computed for wear time epochs and the kilocalories related to BMR theoretically expended
during nonwear time epochs (it is assumed that the periods where the device was not worn corresponded to
sleeping periods, during which energy expenditure is near of BMR), and by multiplying this sum
by 10/9 to take into account the thermic effect of food. Of course, such calculations may
conduct to underestimate TEE and PAL if the device was removed during prolonged periods of
physical activity. Moreover, even if the device was correctly worn, the estimate of PAL is very
approximate since both BMR and kilocalories are estimated using methods
that may not be accurate at the individual level.
</p>
<p>The intensity gradient and the MX metrics are obtained using the <code>compute_intensity_distri_metrics</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of objects: <code>df_all_metrics</code>, <code>p_band</code>, and <code>p_log</code>.
<code>df_all_metrics</code> is a dataframe containing all the metrics for each day.
<code>p_band</code> is a figure that shows the distribution of time spent in the configured bins of intensity for each day of the dataset.
<code>p_log</code> is a figure that shows, for each day, the relationship between the natural log of time spent in each intensity bin with the natural
log of the middle values of the intensity bins.
