<h2>This is the workhorse function of the ACA. It detects significant change-points in serial data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the workhorse function of the ACA. It detects significant change-points in serial data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SDScan(namefi = NULL, xleg = NULL, yleg = NULL, titl = NULL,
  onecol = NULL, daty = NULL, gray = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>namefi</code></td>
<td>
<p>- a character string specifying the data file to be loaded</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xleg</code></td>
<td>
<p>- character. The x-label of the plot</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>yleg</code></td>
<td>
<p>- character. The y-label of the plot</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>titl</code></td>
<td>
<p>- character. The title of the plot</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>onecol</code></td>
<td>
<p>- character. Option for the data format. If <code>onecol</code> is "y", it is assumed that the input file is a single column file (varying parameter) else the input file is a 2 column file (independent variable, varying parameter)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>daty</code></td>
<td>
<p>- character. Option for the data processing. If <code>daty</code> is "y", the scan of the series is launched with the gradients (rates of change) of the data else it is launched with the data itself</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gray</code></td>
<td>
<p>- character. Option for the plot. If <code>gray</code> is "y", the background of the plot is gray else it is white</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>if one of the arguments above is NULL, then the user will be 
prompted to enter the missing value. <code>SDScan()</code> produces two files: the <em>SDS.res</em> file 
includes the statistics for each detected breakpoint; the <em>SDS.png</em> file is the plot of the series 
where the detected breakpoints are shown. In the <em>SDS.res</em> file, there 
is a line for each breakpoint: it includes the x and y values for the breakpoint, its index 
in the series, the noise variance due to the discontinuity, the noise 
variance due to the trend, the noise variance due to the discontinuity 
(posterior value), the noise variance due to the trend (posterior value), 
the change-point Signal-to-Noise Ratio (posterior value), the biweight 
mean of the left segment, the biweight mean of the right segment. Values 
are separated by the ”&amp;” symbol. A change-point plot is returned by <code>SDScan()</code>. This 
plot shows the series and the detected change-points. Horizontal lines 
are drawn to represent the biweight means of the two segments defined 
by each change-point. The legend of the plot shows 4 numerical values 
for each change-point: from left to right, the rank of the change-point 
(as defined by the detection sequence), its location along the X-axis, 
its signal-to-noise ratio, and the probability value for the two-tail 
robust rank-order test, that was obtained right after the change-point 
detection
