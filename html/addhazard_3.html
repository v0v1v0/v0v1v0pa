<h2>An hypothetical two-phase sampling dataset based on nwtsco dataset from

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An hypothetical two-phase sampling dataset based on nwtsco dataset from
the National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nwts2ph
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 3915 rows and 15 variables:
</p>

<p>We create a hypothetical two-phase sampling (stratified sampling) dataset.
In this dataset, only the subjects who have relapses and some of the controls have
their samples sent to the central laboratory for more accurate histology examination.
</p>
<p>Institutional histology is examined in the local hospital. It is usually  available for
all the samples. Central histology is more expensive to obtain since the samples have to be
sent to the central laboratory and the work requires experienced lab scientists.
It is reasonable to assume only some samples were tested for central
histology. Following the two-phase sampling design, we selected subjects for central histology
measurements based on their outcomes and institutional histology results.
