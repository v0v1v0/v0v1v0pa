<h2>Processes a folder of events files to output bubble charts showing the daily
distribution of stepping cadences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Processes a folder of events files to output bubble charts showing
the daily distribution of stepping cadences.
A bubble chart shows daily patterns in stepping behaviour.  For each
valid day of activity data a bubble is plotted on the chart.  The
centre of bubble indicates the weighted median cadence of all stepping
bouts of duration between 10 seconds and one minute (x-axis position)
and the weighted median cadence of all stepping bouts of duration greater
than or equal to one minute (y-axis position).  The height of a bubble
indicates the weighted upper quartile  (y - max) and lower quartile
(y - min) cadence across the stepping bouts of duration greater than or
equal to one minute occurring during the given day.  The width of a bubble
indicates the weighted upper quartile  (x - right) and lower quartile
(x - left) cadence across the stepping bouts of duration between 10 seconds
and one minute occurring during the given day.
Each bubble chart is saved as a .png image.
