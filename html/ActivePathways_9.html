<h2>Hypergeometric test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform a hypergeometric test, also known as the Fisher's exact test, on a 2x2 contingency
table with the alternative hypothesis set to 'greater'. In this application, the test finds the
probability that counts[1, 1] or more genes would be found to be annotated to a term (pathway),
assuming the null hypothesis of genes being distributed randomly to terms.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>counts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A 2x2 numerical matrix representing a contingency table.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a p-value of enrichment of genes in a term or pathway.
