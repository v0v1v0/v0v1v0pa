<h2>Hydro-Meteorological Catchments Datasets for the 'airGR' Packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sample of hydro-meteorological datasets extracted from the 'CAMELS-FR' French database &lt;https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-03687235&gt;. It provides metadata and catchment-scale aggregated hydro-meteorological time series on a pool of French catchments for use by the 'airGR' packages. 
More especially, it can be used by teachers and students for hydrological modeling exercises adapted to the 'airGRteaching' package as described in Delaigue et al. (submitted) and in the 'airGRteaching' vignettes.
</p>
<p>The package contains the following types of datasets:
</p>

<ul><li> <p><code>lumped_daily</code>: a set of lumped catchment daily hydrometeorological time series, and associated metadata.
</p>
</li></ul>
