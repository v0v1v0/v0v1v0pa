<h2>Outdoor Continuous Walking Raw Accelerometry Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Raw accelerometry data collected during
outdoor continuous walking from 32 healthy participants between 23 and 52 years of age.
Data were collected at frequency 100 Hz simultaneously with
four wearable accelerometers located at left wrist, left hip and both ankles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with 2590448 observations of 6 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>subj_id</code> - study participant ID,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loc_id</code> - sensor location, one of: <code>"left_wrist"</code>, <code>"left_hip"</code>, <code>"left_ankle"</code>, <code>"right_ankle"</code>,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>time_s</code> - duration of recorded exercise for a study participant, expressed in seconds,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>x</code> - acceleration measurement time-series collected from a "x" axis of the sensor accelerometer,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>y</code> - acceleration measurement time-series collected from a "y" axis of the sensor accelerometer,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>z</code> - acceleration measurement time-series collected from a "z" axis of the sensor accelerometer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Raw accelerometry data of continuous walking were collected as a part of the
study on Identification of Walking,
Stair Climbing, and Driving Using Wearable Accelerometers, sponsored by the Indiana
University CTSI grant and conducted at the Department of Biostatistics,
Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University. The study was led by Dr.
Jaroslaw Harezlak, assisted by Drs. William Fadel and Jacek Urbanek.
The study was approved by the IRB of Indiana University;
all participants provided written informed consent.
Attached data set is anonymized.
</p>
<p>Study enrolled 32 healthy participants between 23 and 52 years of age.
Participants were asked, among others, to perform self-paced, undisturbed,
outdoor walking on the sidewalk. Accelerometry data were collected
simultaneously at four body locations: left wrist, left hip, left ankle,
and right ankle, at frequency 100 Hz. Duration time of outdoor walking exercise
ranges between 2,5 to 4 minutes for study participants.
