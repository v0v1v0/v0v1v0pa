<h2>Agricultural Land Use Evaluation System</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Agricultural Land Use Evaluation System (ALUES) is 
a package that evaluates land suitability for
different crop production. The package is based on 
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the 
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) methodology 
for land evaluation. Development of ALUES is inspired by 
similar tool for land evaluation, Land Use Suitability 
Evaluation Tool (LUSET). The package uses fuzzy logic 
approach to evaluate land suitability of a particular
area based on inputs such as rainfall,
temperature, topography, and soil properties. The 
membership functions used for fuzzy modeling are the
following: Triangular, Trapezoidal, Gaussian, Sigmoidal 
and custom models with functions that can be
defined by the user. The package also aims on complicated 
methods like considering more than one fuzzy membership 
function on different suitability class. The methods for 
computing the overall suitability of a particular area are 
also included, and these are the Minimum, Maximum, Product, 
Sum, Average, Exponential and Gamma. Finally, ALUES utilizes 
the power of Rcpp library for efficient computation.
