<h2> Rats Diet Experiment </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>“Weil (1970) in Table 1 gives the results from an experiment comprising two treatments. One group of 
16 pregnant female rats was fed a control diet during pregnancy and lactation, the diet of a second group of 16 pregnant 
females was treated with a chemical. For each litter the number <code class="reqn">n</code> of pups alive at 4 days and the number <code class="reqn">x</code> 
of pups that survived the 21 day lactation period were recorded.” (Williams, 1975, p. 951).</p>
