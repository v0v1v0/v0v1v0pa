Half-Weight Index
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the half-weight index
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">HWI(x, Ya, Yb, Yab)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>Number of times individuals a and b were observed together
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ya</code></td>
<td>

<p>Number of times individual a was observed without b
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Yb</code></td>
<td>

<p>Number of times individual b was observed without a
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Yab</code></td>
<td>

<p>Number of times individuals a and b were observed at the same time but not associating
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The half-weight index calculates the probability that two individuals are observed together given that one has been seen, but under the assumption that the probability of missing individuals a or b when they are together is equal to M times the probability of missing them when they are apart. This index is the most commonly used in animal social network analysis, but note that Hoppitt &amp; Farine (in prep) and other authors argue that the weighting of the probabilities is arbitrary.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns two elements: the estimated association strength and the standard error of the estimate.
