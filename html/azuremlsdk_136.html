<h2>Register an environment in the workspace</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The environment is automatically registered with your workspace when you
submit an experiment or deploy a web service. You can also manually register
the environment with <code>register_environment()</code>. This operation makes the
environment into an entity that is tracked and versioned in the cloud, and
can be shared between workspace users.
</p>
<p>Whe used for the first time in training or deployment, the environment is
registered with the workspace, built, and deployed on the compute target.
The environments are cached by the service. Reusing a cached environment
takes much less time than using a new service or one that has bee updated.
</p>
