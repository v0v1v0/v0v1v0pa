<h2>Create a new set-based recurrence schedule</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Often, a single rrule will be sufficient. However, more complex
recurrence objects can be constructed by combining multiple rschedules into
a <em>recurrence set</em>.
</p>
<p>There are three types of recurrence sets provided in almanac, each of
which construct their event sets by performing a set operation on the
underlying events of the rschedules in the set.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>runion()</code> takes the union.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rintersect()</code> takes the intersection.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rsetdiff()</code> takes the set difference.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">runion(...)

rintersect(...)

rsetdiff(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[rschedules]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>rschedule objects to add to the set.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For <code>rsetdiff()</code>, the event set is created "from left to right" and depends
on the order that the rschedules were added to the set.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A runion, rintersect, or rsetdiff.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">since &lt;- "2019-04-01"
until &lt;- "2019-05-31"

on_weekends &lt;- weekly(since = since, until = until) %&gt;%
  recur_on_weekends()

on_25th &lt;- monthly(since = since, until = until) %&gt;%
  recur_on_day_of_month(25)

# On weekends OR the 25th of the month
ru &lt;- runion(on_weekends, on_25th)
alma_events(ru)

# On weekends AND the 25th of the month
ri &lt;- rintersect(on_weekends, on_25th)
alma_events(ri)

# On weekends AND NOT the 25th of the month
rsd1 &lt;- rsetdiff(on_weekends, on_25th)
alma_events(rsd1)

# On the 25th of the month AND NOT the weekend
rsd2 &lt;- rsetdiff(on_25th, on_weekends)
alma_events(rsd2)
</code></pre>
