Uniformity trials of oat hay and wheat grain
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uniformity trials of oat hay and wheat grain, at West Virginia
Agricultural Experiment Station, 1923-1924, on the same land.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 270 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>row</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>row</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>col</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>column</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>oats</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>yield of oat hay, pounds</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>wheat</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>yield of wheat grain, bu</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each plot was 68 feet x 21 feet. After discarding a 3.5 foot border on
all sides, the harvested area was 61 feet x 14 feet. The plots were
laid out in doubles with a 14-foot roadway between the plots.
</p>
<p>Note: The orientation of the plots is a guess.
</p>
<p>Field width: 6 plots * 68 feet + 14 ft/roadway * 2 = 436 feet
</p>
<p>Field length: 45 plots * 21 feet/plot = 945 feet
</p>
<p>In 1923 the field was planted to oats and harvested as hay.
</p>
<p>In 1924 the field was planted to wheat and harvested for grain.
</p>
<p>Garber: "Plots 211 to 214, and 261 to 264, [note, these are rows
11-14, columns 5-6] inclusive, were eliminated from this study because
of the fact that a few years ago a straw stack had stood on or in the
vicinity...which undoubtedly accounts for the relatively high yields
on plots 261 to 264, inclusive."
</p>
<p>Note: The source document contained mean-subtracted yields.  The oat
yield in row 22, column 5 was given as +59.7.  This is obviously
incorrect, since the negative yields all end in '.7' and positive
yields all ended in '.3'.  We used -59.7 as the centered yield value
and added the mean of 1883.7 to all centered yields to obtain absolute
yields.
</p>
<p>Note: Another paper by these authors,
"A Method of Laying Out Experimental Plats", contains three additional
years of uniformity trials, with each crop expressed as a percentage.
