<p><code>load.audio.driver</code> attempts to load a modular audio driver and,
if succeessful, makes it the current audio driver.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">audio.drivers()
current.audio.driver()

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>name of the driver to load (as it appears in the

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The audio package comes with several built-in audio drivers
(currently "wmm": WindowsMultiMedia for MS Windows, "macosx":
AudioUnits for Mac OS X and "portaudio": PortAudio for unix), but it
also supports 3rd-party drivers to be loaded (e.g. from other
packages).
</p>
<p>All operations that create new audio instances (<code>play</code>
and <code>record</code>) use the current audio driver. The audio
package allows the user to switch between different audio
drivers. Each audio instance is tied to the driver it was created
with even if the current driver was changed in the meantime.
</p>
<p>Drivers are references by its short name listed in the <code>name</code>
column in the list of available drivers (obtainable via
<code>audio.drivers</code>).
</p>
<p>An audio driver is any shared module that provides a C function
<code>create_audio_driver</code> which returns a pointer to a populated
structure <code>audio_driver</code> as defined in <code>driver.h</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>audio.drivers</code> returns a data frame lising all availbale
drivers
</p>
<p><code>set.audio.driver</code> and <code>current.audio.driver</code> return the
name of the active driver or <code>NULL</code> if no drivers ar avaliable.
</p>
<p><code>load.audio.driver</code> returns the name of the loaded driver.
</p>
