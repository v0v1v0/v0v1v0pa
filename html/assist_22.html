<h2>Hormone Measurements of Cortisol</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>horm.cort</code> data frame has 425 rows and 4 columns of data representing measurement of cortisol on 36 individuals.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(horm.cort)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data frame contains the following columns:
</p>
<p>ID a vector of index indicating individuals on whom measures were made.
</p>
<p>time a numeric vector of time points of every 2 hours in 24 hours. The time is scaled into [0, 1].
</p>
<p>type a vector of character strings identifying the groups, "normal", "depressed", or "cushing", which the individuals belong to.
</p>
<p>conc cortisol concentration measurements in <code class="reqn">log10</code> scale.
