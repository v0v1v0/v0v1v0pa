Temporary grid search
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The aim is to search for the grid with the name obtained in the function time_grid in the local path entered. If only one hour is entered, it returns the grid in shapefile format saved in the local directory. In the case of a range of hours, an average grid of the time range is returned.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">temporary_grid_search(start_hour, end_hour = NULL, dir, time_format, gridID, shapeValue)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start_hour</code></td>
<td>

<p>String vector that represents the date and time of interest to estimate the exposure, indicating the start time of the activity and/or the trip. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end_hour</code></td>
<td>

<p>String vector that represents the date and time of interest to estimate the exposure, indicating the end of the activity and/or the trip. If you want to obtain a specific time interval that denotes the duration of an activity and/or trip of the same day, you need to provide this parameter. If not, it defaults to NULL.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>

<p>String vector with the path to the local directory where the shapefiles that have the information about the concentrations of the pollutants of interest are located.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_format</code></td>
<td>

<p>String vector representing the structure using special strptime abbreviations, indicating how the date data was provided (e.g. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gridID</code></td>
<td>

<p>String vector with the name of the field containing the unique identifier (ID) for the grid. The ID is a unique number assigned to each pixel within the concentration grid in the shapefile (e.g. GRI1_ID)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shapeValue</code></td>
<td>
<p>String vector with the name of the field corresponding to the concentrations in the shapefile files (e.g. value)</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function is used internally in the model of dynamic and fixed variables. The output is the reading of the grid in local path, where a file of class "sf" and "data.frame" is read.
