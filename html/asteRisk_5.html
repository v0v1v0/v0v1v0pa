<h2>Convert coordinates from GCRF to ITRF
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The GCRF (Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame) frame of reference is an 
Earth-centered inertial coordinate frame, where the origin is placed at the 
center of mass of Earth and the coordinate frame is fixed with respect to the 
stars (and therefore not fixed with respect to the Earth surface in its 
rotation). The X-axis is aligned with the mean equinox of Earth at 12:00
Terrestrial Time on the 1st of January, 2000, and the Z-axis is aligned with
the Earth´s rotation axis.
</p>
<p>It is almost equivalent to the J2000 frame of reference (also called EME2000), 
and in some contexts it is also referred to as ICRF frame (although in its 
strict definition, the origin of coordinates is placed at the barycenter of the 
Solar System).
</p>
<p>In the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame), the origin is also 
placed at the center of mass of Earth, but the frame rotates with respect to the 
stars to remain fixed with respect to the Earth surface as it rotates. The 
Z-axis extends along the true North as defined by the IERS reference pole, and 
the X-axis extends towards the intersection between the equator and the 
Greenwich meridian at any time.
</p>
<p>The coordinates and velocities input and calculated with the high-precision
orbital propagator (hpop) are in the GCRF frame of reference.
</p>
<p>This function requires the <code>asteRiskData</code> package, which can be installed 
by running <code>install.packages('asteRiskData', repos='https://rafael-ayala.github.io/drat/')</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GCRFtoITRF(position_GCRF, velocity_GCRF, dateTime)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>position_GCRF</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector with the X, Y and Z components of the position
of an object in GCRF frame, in m.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>velocity_GCRF</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector with the X, Y and Z components of the velocity
of an object in GCRF frame, in m/s.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dateTime</code></td>
<td>
<p>Date-time string with the date and time in UTC corresponding
to the provided position and velocity vectors. This specifies the time for 
which the conversion from GCRF to ITRF coordinates will be performed. It is
important to provide an accurate value, since the point over the surface of
Earth to which a set of GCRF coordinates refers varies with time due to
the motion of Earth.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with two elements representing the position and velocity of the satellite
in the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) frame of reference. 
Position values are in m, and velocity values are in m/s. Each of the two 
elements contains three values, corresponding to the X, Y and Z components of 
position and velocity in this order.
