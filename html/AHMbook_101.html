Time-to-detection data for peregrines from the French Jura mountains

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Between 7 and 9 March 2015, 38 breeding cliffs were visited up to 3 times to survey for Peregrine Falcons (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>). Observation duration varied from 3 to 95 minutes. The time to detection was recorded for each bird seen. If no birds were seen, the time was entered as NA.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Using the built-in data set instead of the TXT file for the example in Section
#  10.12 of the book is easy, as the format is the same as the file.

?ttdPeregrine  # check the description of the data
data(ttdPeregrine)
# Instead of data &lt;- read.table("ttdPeregrine.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t") do:
data &lt;- ttdPeregrine

# Then continue with the rest of the analysis on p.618
