<h2>Data from Freeman, Heathcote, Chalmers, &amp; Hockley (2010)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lexical decision and word naming latencies for 300 words and 300 nonwords presented in Freeman, Heathcote, Chalmers, and Hockley (2010). The study had one between-subjects factors, <code>"task"</code> with two levels (<code>"naming"</code> or <code>"lexdec"</code>), and four within-subjects factors: <code>"stimulus"</code> type with two levels (<code>"word"</code> or <code>"nonword"</code>), word <code>"density"</code> and word <code>"frequency"</code> each with two levels (<code>"low"</code> and <code>"high"</code>) and stimulus <code>"length"</code> with three levels (4, 5, and 6).

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fhch2010
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> with 13,222 obs. of 9 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>participant id, <code>factor</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>task</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> with two levels indicating which task was performed: <code>"naming"</code> or <code>"lexdec"</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>stimulus</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> indicating whether the shown stimulus was a <code>"word"</code> or <code>"nonword"</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>density</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> indicating the neighborhood density of presented items with two levels: <code>"low"</code> and <code>"high"</code>. Density is defined as the number of words that differ from a base word by one letter or phoneme.</p>
</dd>
<dt>frequency</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> indicating the word frequency of presented items with two levels: <code>"low"</code> (i.e., words that occur less often in natural language) and <code>"high"</code> (i.e., words that occur more often in natural language).</p>
</dd>
<dt>length</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> with 3 levels (4, 5, or 6) indicating the number of characters of presented stimuli.</p>
</dd>
<dt>item</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> with 600 levels: 300 words and 300 nonwords</p>
</dd>
<dt>rt</dt>
<dd>
<p>response time in seconds</p>
</dd>
<dt>log_rt</dt>
<dd>
<p>natural logarithm of response time in seconds</p>
</dd>
<dt>correct</dt>
<dd>
<p>boolean indicating whether or not the response in the lexical decision task was correct or incorrect (incorrect responses of the naming task are not part of the data).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the lexical-decision condition (N = 25), subjects indicated whether each item was a word or a nonword, by pressing either the left (labeled word) or right (labeled nonword) outermost button on a 6-button response pad. The next study item appeared immediately after the lexical decision response was given. In the naming condition (N = 20), subjects were asked to name each item aloud, and items remained on screen for 3 s. Naming time was recorded by a voice key.
</p>
<p>Items consisted of 300 words, 75 in each set making up a factorial combination of high and low density and frequency, and 300 nonwords, with equal numbers of 4, 5, and 6 letter items in each set.
